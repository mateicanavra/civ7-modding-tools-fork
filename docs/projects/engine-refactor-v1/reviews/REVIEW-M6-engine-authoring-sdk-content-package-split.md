## REVIEW m6-u01-promote-runtime-pipeline-as-engine-sdk-surface

### Quick Take
Runtime pipeline is promoted to the engine surface with updated imports/tests and a minimal engine-owned context; acceptance criteria are met, with legacy exports left for later M6 cleanup.

### High-Leverage Issues
- None noted.

### Fix Now (Recommended)
- None.

### Defer / Follow-up
- Track removal of legacy exports (base/config/bootstrap, PipelineModV1) in the later M6 legacy-cleanup slice.

### Needs Discussion
- None.

### Cross-cutting Risks
- None noted.
