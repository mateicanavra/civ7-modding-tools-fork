# Ecology Vertical Domain Refactor — Phase 3 Implementation Plan

This issue is the Phase 3 output for the Ecology vertical refactor workflow.

References:
- Plan: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/ECOLOGY.md
- Phase 1 spike: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/spike-ecology-current-state.md
- Phase 2 spike: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/spike-ecology-modeling.md
- Workflow: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/WORKFLOW.md

Scope guardrails:
- Slice planning only. No model changes here.
- Every slice ends pipeline-green (no dual paths).
- The refactored domain must not retain compat surfaces; downstream adjustments are part of the plan.
