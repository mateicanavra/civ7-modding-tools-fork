# Civ7 Map Generation — Gameplay Lever Inventory (Draft)

## Goal

Capture **evidence-backed** mapgen-time gameplay levers from Civ7 official scripts/data, so Gameplay scope is grounded in what is actually possible.

## Notes on Searching

Official resources often live under a path that is ignored by default tooling.
Prefer:
- `rg --no-ignore` when scanning `.civ7/outputs/resources/**`

## Known Levers (Seed)

The canonical seed list and evidence paths live in:
- `docs/system/libs/mapgen/research/SPIKE-gameplay-mapgen-touchpoints.md`

This document will be expanded with additional “hidden” levers discovered in utility scripts.
