# Gameplay Domain (Draft Planning Home)

This directory is the project-scoped “home” for **Gameplay domain** refactor planning.

Canonical evidence (design-level, low churn) lives in system research:
- `docs/system/libs/mapgen/research/SPIKE-gameplay-mapgen-touchpoints.md`

Repo-specific wiring inventory and concrete planning artifacts live here (and in the project spike folder):
- `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spike/spike-gameplay-domain-refactor-plan-notes.md`

## Contents
