# Morphology Domain Refactor — Phase 1 Current-State Spike

This spike is the Phase 1 output for the Morphology vertical refactor workflow.

References:
- Plan: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/morphology/MORPHOLOGY.md
- Workflow: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/WORKFLOW.md

Goal: ground the Morphology refactor in current-state reality (wiring, contracts, boundary violations) so Phase 2/3 can be re-scoped based on evidence.
