# Morphology Domain Refactor — Phase 0.5 Greenfield Spike

This spike is the Phase 0.5 output for the Morphology vertical refactor workflow.

References:
- Plan: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/morphology/MORPHOLOGY.md
- Workflow: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/WORKFLOW.md

Goal: establish the first-principles Morphology model (ownership, causality spine, public vs internal surfaces) before current-state inventory and before authoritative Phase 2 modeling.

## Phase 0.5 scope guardrails

- Greenfield-only. Do not justify or constrain the model by current implementation details.
- No slice planning here.

## Domain ownership (Morphology vs neighbors)

TBD.

## Causality spine (conceptual decomposition)

TBD.

## Public vs internal surfaces (early call)

TBD.

## Upstream and downstream diffs (change candidates)

TBD.

## Narrative/story overlays posture (locked)

TBD.

## Lookback 0.5

TBD.
