Phase 1: Morphology Current-State SpikeStatus: Draft / EvidenceAuthor: SystemDate: 2025-05-18Scope: Inventory and analysis of the existing Morphology domain implementation.Reference: mods/mod-swooper-maps/src/domain/morphology/ and mods/mod-swooper-maps/src/recipes/standard/stages/1. Executive SummaryCurrent Morphology execution is distributed across three recipe stages: morphology-pre, morphology-mid, and morphology-post. While it successfully generates a playable heightmap, it suffers from Domain Bleed (owning logic that belongs in Hydrology) and Legacy Coupling (reliance on narrative overlays and magic numbers).Key Findings:Fragmentation: Logic is split arbitrarily between "Pre", "Mid", and "Post" stages without clear semantic distinction.Hydrology Leakage: The morphology-mid stage currently executes routing (Flow Routing), which Phase 0.5 explicitly assigns to the Hydrology domain.Overlay Dependency: The system currently relies on story/overlays to force shapes, violating the "Physics First" and "No Overlays" rules of the refactor.Opaque Inputs: Tectonic interactions are modeled loosely via plateGraph and tectonics steps in Foundation, but Morphology consumes them largely as static masks rather than dynamic stress vectors.2.

Move to Hydrology.compute-sea-level: Determines the Z-slice for water.compute-substrate: Defines rock types (Sedimentary/Igneous). Good, keep for Ecology.plan-ridges-and-foothills: Specific mountain placement logic.plan-volcanoes: Point-based volcano placement.plan-island-chains: Seamount/hotspot logic.2.3 Artifacts ProducedGlobalHeightmap: The primary Float32Array elevation buffer.Landmask: Boolean or Uint8Array (1=Land, 0=Water).CoastlineDistance: Scalar field.FlowDirections: [Legacy] Currently produced here, moving to Hydrology.SubstrateMap: Rock types.3.

Legacy Surface Inventory4.1 Narrative OverlaysEvidence: mods/mod-swooper-maps/src/recipes/standard/overlays.tsThe current pipeline explicitly imports src/domain/narrative/overlays.Impact: Overlays inject hard-coded shapes or masks that bypass the geomorphic simulation.Action: As per Phase 0.5, these must be removed. Shape control must move to Input Parameters (e.g., specific plate generation seeds or constraint maps) rather than post-process overwrites.4.2 Hidden Constants & Magic NumbersEvidence: mods/mod-swooper-maps/src/domain/morphology/config.tsMany tuning values (erosion rates, noise scales, mountain thresholds) are likely buried in default strategy files (e.g., strategies/default.ts inside op folders) rather than exposed in a top-level schema.Action: These must be surfaced into the MorphologyConfig schema or defined as explicit internal constants.5. Upstream Intake Scan (Foundation)Current Consumption:Morphology reads FoundationContext.Uses plates (ID map) and mesh (Voronoi geometry).Gap (vs Phase 0.5):No explicit PlateMotionVectors or Stress fields are currently consumed to drive orogeny. Mountains are likely placed based on simple "Edge Distance" logic rather than "Convergence Velocity".6.

Downstream Consumer RisksHydrology Breakage: Moving compute-flow-routing out of Morphology will break the current Hydrology stage if it expects those artifacts to already exist in the Context. Hydrology must be updated to run this op itself.Engine Projection: If morphology-post steps are writing directly to the C++ engine (e.g. TerrainBuilder.setTerrain(...)), this coupling must be broken. Morphology should output a POJO/TypedArray, and a separate Adapter step should write to the Engine.Lookback 1Did we invent new designs? No. We strictly cataloged the existing pre/mid/post structure and the ops within src/domain/morphology.Did we find the legacy overlays? Yes, src/recipes/standard/overlays.ts is the smoking gun.Is the upstream gap confirmed? Yes, Foundation provides plates, but not the rich vector data envisioned in Phase 0.5.Is the downstream leak confirmed? Yes, compute-flow-routing is currently residing in Morphology, confirming the need to move it to Hydrology.
