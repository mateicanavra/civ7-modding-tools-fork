# Ecology Domain Refactor — Phase 1 Current-State Spike

This spike is the Phase 1 output for the Ecology vertical refactor workflow.

References:
- Plan: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/ecology/ECOLOGY.md
- Workflow: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/WORKFLOW.md

Goal: ground the Ecology refactor in current-state reality (wiring, contracts, boundary violations) so Phase 2/3 can be re-scoped based on evidence.

---

## Phase 0 baseline gates (status: pending)

Status: not run.

## Phase 1 hypotheses to validate (from plan)

- /src/domain/ecology/ops/contracts.ts is populated (contract router exists).
- /src/recipes/standard/stages/ecology/ exists and compiles a stage config surface.
- Some Ecology step modules still use legacy dependency wiring patterns (validate and record).

## Domain surface inventory (outside view)

TBD.

## Contract matrix (current-state)

TBD.

## Legacy surface inventory (config properties + rules/policies + functions)

TBD.

## Upstream authoritative input review

TBD.

## Decisions + defaults (initial)

TBD.

## Risk register (initial)

TBD.

## Golden path candidate

TBD.

## Deletion list

TBD.

## Lookback 1

TBD.
