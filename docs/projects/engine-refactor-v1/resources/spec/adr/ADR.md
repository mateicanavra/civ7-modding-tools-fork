# ADR Log (Spec)

This log tracks decisions that are adjacent to the target architecture spec and should not live inside the canonical spec itself.

## How to use

- Add new ADR entries as separate files under `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spec/adr/`.
- Link each ADR here with a one-line summary and date.
