# Hydrology Domain Refactor — Phase 2 Modeling Spike

This spike is the Phase 2 output for the Hydrology vertical refactor workflow.

References:
- Plan: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/plans/HYDROLOGY.md
- Workflow: docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/workflow/domain-refactor/WORKFLOW.md

Goal: define the authoritative, first-principles Hydrology model and lock target contract surfaces.

---

## Phase 2 scope guardrails

- Model-first only. No slice planning here.
- If compatibility surfaces conflict with the model, the model wins.

## Canonical model + causality spine

TBD.

## Target contract matrix (buffers/artifacts/overlays)

TBD.

## Legacy disposition ledger (keep/kill/migrate)

TBD.

## Upstream authoritative input selection

TBD.

## Decisions + defaults (modeling decisions)

TBD.

## Risk register (modeling risks)

TBD.

## Golden path (authoritative)

TBD.

## Projection policy (explicitly non-canonical)

TBD.

## Pipeline delta list (upstream/downstream contract changes)

TBD.

## Required updates

- Update docs/system/libs/mapgen/hydrology.md

## Lookback 2

TBD.
