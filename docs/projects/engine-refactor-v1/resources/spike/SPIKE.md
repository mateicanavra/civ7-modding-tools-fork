# Spikes (Project Resources)

This directory contains spike material for `engine-refactor-v1`. Spikes are non-canonical working documents; promote durable outcomes into SPEC/ADR/CONTRACT docs.

Notes:
- The “step ↔ domain operation modules” spike is now a canonical SPEC component: `SPEC-step-domain-operation-modules`.
- Migration viability snapshots live in `spike-domain-migration-map.md` (domain portion only).
- Narrative overlays load-bearing inventory (Swooper Maps): `spike-narrative-overlays-load-bearing.md`

Historical (archived under `_archive/`):
- Ground truth snapshots for prior milestones.
- Drift audits for older target-vs-impl reconciliation passes.
- Consolidated “target directive” grab bags superseded by the split SPEC component set.

Notable (archived):
- Feature placement ownership spike: `_archive/spike-ecology-feature-placement-ownership.md`
- Ecology/climate realism pass spike: `_archive/spike-ecology-climate-realism-pass.md`
