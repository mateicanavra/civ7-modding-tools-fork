# Spikes (Project Resources)

This directory reorganizes historical spike material for `engine-refactor-v1` into three conceptual buckets:

- **Ground truth (current system):** `spike-current-m6-system.md`
- **Drift audits (implementation vs expectations):** `spike-drift-m6-vs-spec.md`
- **Target directives/design grab bag (non-canonical staging):** `spike-target.md`

Notes:
- The focused “step ↔ domain operation modules” design spike was moved to a spec-adjacent doc (pending merge): `docs/projects/engine-refactor-v1/resources/spec/SPEC-pending-step-domain-operation-modules.md`.
- `spike-target.md` intentionally consolidates target/design snippets by original source spike filename; some sources were too mixed to cleanly extract without rewriting and are included verbatim with an explicit note.
