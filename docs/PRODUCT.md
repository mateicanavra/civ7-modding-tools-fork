## Overview

**Civ7 Modding Tools** is a comprehensive monorepo workspace for Civilization VII modding. It provides tools, documentation, and an SDK for creating mods programmatically rather than manually editing XML files.

This repository began from [izica/civ7-modding-tools](https://github.com/izica/civ7-modding-tools) and has since diverged; it is maintained independently.

## Who It's For

- **Mod developers** who want type-safe, programmatic mod creation
- **Technical modders** who prefer code over manual XML editing
- **Tool builders** who need reusable libraries for Civ7 data manipulation

## Core Capabilities

- **SDK** — TypeScript SDK for programmatic mod generation with strongly-typed builders
- **CLI** — Command-line tools for managing game resources (zip/unzip, graph visualization)
- **Plugin Libraries** — Reusable logic for file operations, graph crawling, and mod management
- **Documentation** — Comprehensive modding guides and references
- **Playground** — Examples and experimentation space
