# Project Template

```
# Project: <Name>
**Status:** Planned | Active | Complete
**Timeline:** <start → target end>
**Teams:** <team(s)>

## Scope & Objectives
- ...

## Deliverables
- [ ] Deliverable 1 — acceptance criteria
- [ ] Deliverable 2 — acceptance criteria

## Milestones
- M1: <name> — goal & target date
- M2: ...

For multi-milestone projects, also create:
- A **project directional doc** under `docs/projects/<slug>/` (for example, `PROJECT-<slug>.md`) that summarizes goals and points to feature PRDs and milestone docs.
- Per-milestone docs under `docs/projects/<slug>/milestones/` for detailed scope and sequencing.
- Separate **feature PRDs** under `docs/projects/<slug>/resources/PRD-*.md` only when you are changing external contracts or behavior (schema, API surfaces, pipeline/data-product contracts). For small or purely internal changes, keep design notes in the project doc or in issue descriptions instead of creating a new PRD.
