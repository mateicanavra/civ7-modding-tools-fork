# Civilization VII Age Modules

## Overview

One of Civilization VII's defining features is its Ages system, which divides gameplay into three distinct historical periods. Each Age is implemented as a separate module with its own content, rules, and mechanics. This document provides an in-depth look at each Age module's structure, content, and implementation specifics.

Understanding the Age modules is essential for modders, as any content you create must be properly integrated with the appropriate Age to function correctly in-game.

## Common Age Module Structure

All three Age modules (Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern) share a common structure and organization. Based on examination of the game files, each Age module contains:

``` text
age-[name]/
├── age-[name].modinfo       # Module definition
├── package.json             # Package metadata
├── config/                  # Configuration settings
│   └── config.xml           # Core Age properties
├── data/                    # Gameplay data files
│   ├── civilizations.xml    # Age-specific civilizations
│   ├── leaders.xml          # Leader data
│   ├── units.xml            # Units available in this Age
│   ├── constructibles.xml   # Buildings and improvements
│   ├── progression-trees-*.xml  # Tech and civic trees
│   └── various other XMLs   # Age-specific content
├── text/                    # Localization files
├── l10n/                    # Additional localization
├── ui/                      # UI element definitions
├── scripts/                 # JavaScript files
├── metaprogression/         # Progression systems
└── movies/                  # Media resources
```

### Core Files in Each Age

The most important files that define an Age's characteristics are:

1. **age-[name].modinfo**: Defines module identity, dependencies, and actions
2. **config/config.xml**: Contains the core properties of the Age including:

## Age Transitions

One of the most important features of Civilization VII is the transition between Ages. As Creative Director Ed Beach explains, Age transitions address issues like snowballing, excessive micromanagement, and civilization balancing.

### Legacy Paths

Each Age has four Legacy Paths that players can progress along:

1. **Science Path**: Scientific and technological achievements
2. **Military Path**: Combat victories and military development
3. **Culture Path**: Cultural and civic advancements
4. **Economy Path**: Resource production and financial growth

Completing milestones on these paths provides Legacy Points that contribute to Age Progress, and completing an entire path unlocks a Golden Age Legacy for the next Age. Failing to complete any milestones on a path results in a Dark Age Legacy.

### Persistent Elements During Transitions

During Age transitions, several elements persist to maintain continuity:

1. **Leaders**: Leaders remain the same across all Ages
2. **Ageless Buildings**: Wonders and unique Quarters persist as "Ageless" structures
3. **Commander Units**: Commander attributes and experience continue
4. **Traditions**: Social policies unlocked from Civic trees remain available

As Edward Zhang, Economics Feature Lead, notes: "Leaders persist across all Ages, ensuring you always have a sense of who is part of your empire, and who are your rivals. Relationships that you develop persist, and Leaders continue to grow by leveling up their attributes."

### Implementation in XML

Age transitions are defined in various XML files, including:

``` xml
{/*<GAME_RESOURCES>/Base/modules/base-standard/definitions/age-transition.civdb defines the structure*/}
{/*While each age module implements specific transitions*/}

<AgeTransitions>
    <Row FromAgeType="AGE_ANTIQUITY" 
         ToAgeType="AGE_EXPLORATION" 
         LegacyPointsRequired="100" 
         UnlocksNewLeaders="true"
         LeaderDomain="StandardLeaders" />
</AgeTransitions>

<LegacyPaths>
    <Row LegacyPathType="LEGACY_PATH_SCIENCE" 
         Name="LOC_LEGACY_PATH_SCIENCE_NAME" 
         Description="LOC_LEGACY_PATH_SCIENCE_DESCRIPTION"
         Icon="ICON_LEGACY_PATH_SCIENCE" />
    {/*Military, Culture, Economy paths similarly defined*/}
</LegacyPaths>

<LegacyTiers>
    <Row LegacyPathType="LEGACY_PATH_SCIENCE" 
         Tier="1" 
         PointsRequired="20" 
         RewardType="LEGACY_REWARD_SCIENCE_1" />
    {/*Additional tiers with increasing requirements*/}
</LegacyTiers>
```

## Assigning Content to Specific Ages

When creating mods, you need to properly assign your content to the appropriate Age(s). This determines when the content is available to players.

### Civilization Assignment

To assign a civilization to an Age, use the CivilizationDomains table:

``` xml
<CivilizationDomains>
    <Row CivilizationType="CIVILIZATION_DACIA" Domain="AntiquityAgeCivilizations" />
</CivilizationDomains>
```

The available domains are:
- **AntiquityAgeCivilizations**: For civilizations starting in the Antiquity Age
- **ExplorationAgeCivilizations**: For civilizations in the Exploration Age
- **ModernAgeCivilizations**: For civilizations in the Modern Age

### Unit Assignment

Units can be assigned to specific Ages through tech tree prerequisites:

``` xml
<Units>
    <Row UnitType="UNIT_DACIA_FALX_WARRIOR" 
         PrereqTech="TECH_IRON_WORKING" />
</Units>
```

By using a tech available only in a specific Age, you restrict when the unit becomes available.

### Building Assignment

Similarly, buildings can be restricted to Ages:

``` xml
<Buildings>
    <Row BuildingType="BUILDING_DACIA_FORTRESS" 
         PrereqTech="TECH_ENGINEERING" />
</Buildings>
```

### Cross-Age Content

Some content can exist across multiple Ages. Define this by setting appropriate values:

``` xml
<Buildings>
    <Row BuildingType="BUILDING_WORLD_WONDER_PYRAMIDS" 
         IsAgeless="true" />
</Buildings>
```

The "IsAgeless" property ensures the content persists across Age transitions.

## Practical Implementation Tips

When creating mods that work with the Age system, consider these best practices:

1. **Age-Appropriate Content**: Design civilizations, units, and buildings that fit the historical context of their Age
2. **Proper Dependencies**: Ensure your mod depends on the appropriate Age module(s)
3. **Transition Planning**: Consider how your content transitions between Ages (if at all)
4. **Age-Specific Mechanics**: Leverage the unique systems in each Age (religion in Exploration, global systems in Modern)
5. **Path Integration**: If adding new legacy paths or objectives, ensure they balance with existing content
6. **Leader Continuity**: Remember that leaders persist across Ages, so design leader abilities that remain relevant

## Conclusion

The Age system is a foundational element of Civilization VII, significantly changing how content is organized and experienced. By understanding each Age module's unique characteristics and the transition mechanics between them, modders can create content that integrates seamlessly with the game's progression systems.

Whether creating an ancient civilization for the Antiquity Age, naval units for the Exploration Age, or modern systems for the final Age, proper integration with these module structures ensures your mod functions correctly and provides an authentic experience for players.
