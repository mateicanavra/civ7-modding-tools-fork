# Civilization VII Modding Architecture

## Core Architecture Overview

Civilization VII uses a highly modular architecture organized around "modules" - self-contained packages of content that can be loaded independently. This represents a significant evolution from previous Civilization titles, with content now strictly compartmentalized by era (Ages) and type.

The game's core structure consists of:

1. **Base Modules** - Fundamental game systems shared across all content
2. **Age Modules** - Era-specific content packages (Antiquity, Exploration, Modern)
3. **Standard Modules** - Core gameplay definitions and shared resources

Each module is essentially a self-contained mod with its own `.modinfo` definition file, making the base game itself a collection of interconnected mods. This architecture makes Civilization VII inherently more moddable than its predecessors.

## The Ages System

Civilization VII's defining feature is its Ages system, which directly impacts how modding works. For detailed information on the Ages system, see the [Age Architecture](/community/guides/ages/age-architecture) document.

## Module Relationships

The base game content is distributed across multiple modules that work together:

- **base-standard**: Core gameplay definitions, rules, and systems
- **age-antiquity**, **age-exploration**, **age-modern**: Age-specific content (details in [Age Architecture](/community/guides/ages/age-architecture))

Custom mods can interact with these modules through dependencies, additions, or modifications, giving modders precise control over which parts of the game they affect.

### Module File Structure

Examining the actual game files, each module follows a consistent structure:

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="community-guides-modding-architecture__d8aec66c" tag="xml"
<GAME_RESOURCES>/Base/modules/module-name/
├── module-name.modinfo   # Module definition file
├── package.json          # Package metadata
├── config/               # Configuration settings
├── data/                 # XML files for game elements
│   ├── civilizations.xml # Civilization definitions (not in subfolders)
│   ├── leaders.xml       # Leader definitions
│   ├── units.xml         # Unit definitions
│   ├── ...               # Other game element files
├── definitions/          # Database schemas (.civdb files, base-standard only)
├── text/                 # Localization files
├── l10n/                 # Additional localization
├── ui/                   # UI element definitions
├── scripts/              # JavaScript files for game logic
└── movies/               # Media resources
```

Key differences between module types:
- **Base-Standard**: Contains the `definitions` folder with `.civdb` schema files that define game structures
- **Age Modules**: Focus on content specific to that historical period, but lack definition files
- **DLC Modules**: Similar structure but typically focus on specific civilizations or leaders

## Core Modding Concepts

### Mod Structure

A basic Civilization VII mod consists of:

1. **`.modinfo` file** - XML definition that identifies the mod and specifies how it loads
2. **Data files** - XML/SQL content that adds or modifies game elements
3. **Text files** - Localization entries for in-game text
4. **UI files** - JavaScript (JS) files for interface modifications (Civ VII uses JS instead of Lua)
5. **Map scripts** - JS files for procedural map generation (if applicable)

When creating a mod, it should be installed in the user's mod directory at `<GAME_DATA>/Mods/your-mod-name/`.

### Mod Loading Process

When Civilization VII loads a mod:

1. The game reads the mod's `.modinfo` file to identify dependencies and actions
2. Action groups define what files to load and when they should load
3. Conditionally loaded content may depend on game state (e.g., current Age)
4. Database updates are applied to game tables
5. Text updates are merged with existing localization
6. UI modifications replace or enhance existing interfaces
7. Custom scripts are executed for specialized functionality

### Database Approach

Most modding in Civilization VII is accomplished through:

- **Insertions** - Adding new rows to game tables (new civilizations, units, buildings)
- **Updates** - Modifying existing values (changing unit stats, building yields)
- **Replacements** - Completely replacing entries (changing text or behaviors)

The game's database is defined by schemas that outline the structure and relationships of all game elements. Key schema files include:
- Core gameplay schema (`<GAME_RESOURCES>/Base/Assets/schema/gameplay/01_GameplaySchema.sql`)
- Modding framework schema (`<GAME_RESOURCES>/Base/Assets/schema/modding/schema-modding-10.sql`)
- Icon management schema (`<GAME_RESOURCES>/Base/Assets/schema/icons/IconManager.sql`)
- Localization schema (`<GAME_RESOURCES>/Base/Assets/schema/loc/schema-loc-10.sql`)

## Modding Workflow

A typical modding workflow involves:

1. **Planning** - Determining scope and dependencies for your mod
2. **Setup** - Creating the mod folder and `.modinfo` file
3. **Implementation** - Writing XML/SQL data, text, and scripts
4. **Testing** - Ensuring the mod works as expected in-game
5. **Iteration** - Refining based on testing and feedback
6. **Distribution** - Packaging for sharing with other players

### Age Transitions and Mod Compatibility

For details on handling age transitions in mods, see the [Age Architecture](/community/guides/ages/age-architecture) document.

## Best Practices

### Organization

- Use unique identifiers for all content (prefixed with mod name)
- Maintain consistent folder structure for easy navigation
- Group related files logically (data, text, UI, etc.)
- Comment code for clarity and future maintenance

### Compatibility

- Specify clear dependencies on base modules
- Use conditional loading for era-specific content
- Avoid direct edits to base game files
- Test with other popular mods when possible

### Technical Execution

- Follow naming conventions from base game
- Balance new content against existing game elements
- Test incrementally during development
- Use the game's logs for troubleshooting

## Getting Started

For newcomers to Civilization VII modding, we recommend:

1. Review this architecture document to understand the overall structure
2. Examine the [Database Schemas](/community/guides/database-schemas) document to familiarize yourself with game tables
3. Follow the [General: Creating New Civilizations](/community/guides/general-creating-civilizations) or [General: Modifying Existing Content](/community/guides/general-modifying-content) guides for hands-on practice
