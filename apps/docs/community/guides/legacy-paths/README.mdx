sidebarTitle: "Legacy Paths"
description: "Documentation placeholders for legacy modding approaches and migration guidance."
---

This directory will contain documentation for legacy modding approaches that were used in earlier versions of Civilization VII or in previous Civilization titles.

## Purpose

The legacy paths documentation serves several important purposes:

1. **Historical Reference** - Preserving knowledge about previous modding techniques
2. **Cross-Version Compatibility** - Helping modders convert older mods to the current framework
3. **Alternative Approaches** - Documenting methods that may still work but are no longer recommended

## Future Content

This section will include:

1. **Pre-TypeScript Modding** - Documentation on XML/SQL-only approaches used before the TypeScript tools
2. **Previous Civilization Titles** - Migration guides for modders coming from Civilization V and VI
3. **Deprecated Systems** - Information on systems and approaches that have been replaced
4. **Compatibility Layers** - Tools and techniques for maintaining backward compatibility

## Current Status

This section is under development. Legacy paths documentation will be added as the modding ecosystem matures and evolves.

## Importance of Preservation

While new methods and tools improve the modding experience, preserving knowledge of legacy approaches is valuable for:
- Maintaining older mods
- Understanding design decisions in the current framework
- Providing historical context for the evolution of the modding system
