title: "Learning Paths for Civilization VII Modding"
---

This directory contains structured learning paths for different types of modders, from beginners to advanced developers.

## Purpose

The learning paths are designed to guide users through a progressive series of documentation and tutorials that build knowledge incrementally. Unlike standalone guides that focus on specific tasks, learning paths provide a curriculum-style approach to mastering Civilization VII modding.

## Future Content

This section will include:

1. **Beginner Path** - For first-time modders with no prior experience
2. **Content Creator Path** - For those focused on adding new civilizations, leaders, and units
3. **Systems Developer Path** - For those interested in modifying game mechanics and rules
4. **TypeScript Specialist Path** - For developers looking to leverage the TypeScript modding tools
5. **Advanced Modder Path** - For experienced modders looking to create complex, interconnected mods

Each path will include:
- Prerequisites and required knowledge
- Ordered sequence of documentation to read
- Practical exercises and mini-projects
- Recommended tools and resources
- Advanced topics for further exploration

## Current Status

This section is under development. Please check back in future updates for comprehensive learning paths.
