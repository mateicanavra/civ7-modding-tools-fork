			<Text>Angkor Wat – the name simply means “city of temples” – is a vast complex in present-day Cambodia. Originally constructed as a dwelling for Vishnu, the complex went through multiple religious interpretations, from Hindu to Mahayana Buddhist to Theravada Buddhist. It has remained a place of worship for Cambodians (or Khmer, the two words are synonymous) even before its “discovery” by French explorers in the 19th century. The central temple is the largest religious monument in the world, built of sandstone blocks and modeled upon the Hindu-Buddhist heavens: a central mound (Meru) in the center, surrounded by four other blocks. Interestingly, while most temple complexes face east, Angkor faces west.</Text>

As such, they became powerful symbols for would-be conquerors: Angkor was used as a symbol of French Indochina during the colonial occupation, and a model of the temple was added to the Grand Palace at Bangkok during the Siamese occupation of Cambodia. The site’s profile also appears on Cambodian flags from the Khmer Rouge to the present day.</Text>

On this stage, the sport of the ancient Romans was on full display. These could be gruesome affairs, often including duels to the death or battles between wild animals such as lions (Roman gladiatorial contests have been cited as the reason lions went extinct in the Mediterranean, although a shifting climate and expanding human population might have had more to do with it). But the Colosseum was an arena for more than just deadly spectacle, hosting public addresses, executions, plays, and sea battles that required the complex’s floor to be filled with water.</Text>

For instance, the Samnite fighters had a long shield and a sharp Roman soldier’s sword (the gladius), Thracians held a short dagger and shield, and the Retiarii had a net and trident. Competitors were not armed in ways that made the most sense, but for whatever made the best sport.</Text>

Regardless, the Colossus was a marker of the might and prosperity of the Greek island. It stood over a hundred feet high, about the size of the modern-day Statue of Liberty, and was made to commemorate the defense of the city against an attack by Macedonian forces descended from Alexander the Great. The victorious defenders sold equipment abandoned by their fleeing enemies and spent this windfall on the statue. </Text>

When the Rhodians heard from the Oracle at Delphi that they had offended Helios, they left it in ruins, though its massive scale continued to attract tourists. In time, the ruins were taken by conquering Arab forces in 653 CE and sold to a merchant from Syria.</Text>

It was a massive feat of engineering, constructed with limited materials and requiring the cultivation of surrounding land. The city’s three square kilometers were enclosed by walls featuring over 150 towers. Inside was a collection of opulent palaces, temples, and a ziggurat, as well as elaborate lamassu and shedu (Assyrian sacred beasts) statues. Dur-Sharrukin also held a sprawling garden composed of trees from every land that Sargon conquered. These gardens became the inspiration for Sennacherib’s gardens at Nineveh, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Persian pairidaeza.</Text>

It is a temple bell that was originally installed in Bongdeoksa Temple, where its sound would call monks to prayer and ring out the time of day. A tube at the top of the bell provides a unique reverberation and famously rich sound. This sound is the source of a rather sinister legend – allegedly when the smiths first sought to make a bell for Bongdeoksa, every bell they cast would fail to produce a sound. A monk dreamed that a working bell needed a sacrifice – that a child needed to be cast into the metal. When the bell is struck today, one can easily imagine its ring calls out “emile,” meaning “mother.” This story is likely a later anti-Buddhist invention or a modern ghoulish ghost story.</Text>

It was his rival’s holiest site, the heart of the empire, where its gold and silver were most concentrated, and where its learning and arts were most evident. His troops entered and sacked the city, burning everything to the ground and killing everyone they found. It has been said that Alexander regretted Parsa’s destruction, but the city remained ruined.</Text>

The Gate of All Nations, built by Xerxes in the 5th century BCE, was an extensive entrance supported by four pillars and decorated with bulls and lamassu (sphinxes with the heads of bearded men). The space was designed to impress, to instill insignificance in its viewers as they stared up at the face of Xerxes the Great – before facing its active ruler.</Text>

			<Text>In the distant past, the hero Maui loaded three massive stones onto his outrigger and sailed to Tonga, where he installed them as his throne. No one else could have lifted them – the endeavor took the strength of a man who could raise the islands of Hawai’i from under the sea. In Tonga, these stones provided later kings a safe sitting place, from which one could see (and strike) any potential assassins should they get too close.</Text>

Tonga was an early Polynesian kingdom (and remains a Polynesian kingdom), having been inhabited for nearly 2,500 years. Like many Polynesian societies, Tonga focused on sea navigation and the cultivation of the personal power (mana) of kings, often tied to the figure of Maui. Monuments like the Ha’amonga ‘a Maui are therefore significant for their remembrance of him and their maintenance of the idea of the power of kings.</Text>

Sargon, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, and others had gardens full of these symbols attached to their palaces, but the quintessential garden was the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Sadly, historians know little more than the name. Does it refer to a destroyed or lost garden in that city? Was it Sennacherib’s palace? Could it have been an idealized Mesopotamian garden? The details are unclear.</Text>

			<Text>At Nineveh, around 700 BCE, Sennacherib raised a massive system of waterworks to feed orchards and gardens with water screws that brought irrigation to higher terraces, which is where the “hanging” name comes from. These gardens were filled with trees such as cypress and pine, dates, pears, grapes, and other fruit. In the midst of the arid Iraqi landscape, such a garden would have been a cool, refreshing oasis – as well as a record of conquest.</Text>

			<Text>In the chaos of the fall of the Western Roman Empire, successor states were often ruled by “barbarian” kings – Theodoric of the Ostrogoths among them. The Goths have retained significant staying power – our modern use of “Gothic” to mean “ghoulish” stems from its use by Italians to disparage the Goths in antiquity; the term was later used to disparage medieval European architecture (gargoyles and flying buttresses, etc.), a style that frequented, and gave name to, the subsequent genre of 18th-19th century horror literature. The Mausoleum of Theodoric is an example of the architecture of the ancient Goths. The structure is a simple stone circle that housed Theodoric’s remains and included a lower level for services. It remains a sign of Italy's early Middle Ages, a period of great transition for the West.</Text>

			<Text>In the ninth century CE, a vast city was constructed in what is modern-day Illinois. Called Cahokia by later residents, it was the heart of Mississippian society and a hallmark of their power, organization, and construction. The city was laid out along the cardinal directions in carefully planned districts. Various halls, temples, and homes were built upon its many man-made mounds.</Text>

Constructed with soil and clay carried by foot in baskets, the structure remains the largest prehistoric earthwork in the Americas. Its base is larger than that of the largest pyramid at Giza. While the original mound was built quickly – perhaps within twenty years – it expanded over the centuries to dominate the landscape. Its four terraces guided visitors to the hall at its flat peak, a wooden structure 100 feet long and almost 50 feet wide, likely a temple or chieftain’s dwelling that would have been visible from anywhere in the city.</Text>

			<Text>The religious significance of Maya astronomy is also noteworthy. The movements of the stars were clues to the dispositions of the gods, so astronomical sites were places of sacrifice and worship, where the gods could be seen directly and given offerings. To the Maya, for instance, the bright star in the morning sky (which we call Venus) was not a ball of sulfur dioxide clouds surrounding a scorching planet. Rather, it was the eye of Kukulkan, through which direct communication was possible from the earth to the heaven – one that required a stage.</Text>

Fittingly, the Bihar region of India is the origin point for both the Buddha and the Buddhist emperor Ashoka – according to legend, Ashoka even laid the foundations for a monastery in the region. However, Nalanda has its origins in the Gupta Empire, which built a massive teaching institution that attracted Buddhist scholars from across the world. This included the Chinese monk Xuanzang, who traveled to India in order to bring back Buddhist records and served as the inspiration for the epic “Journey to the West.” Other pilgrims came from Korea, Java, Srivijaya (Sumatra), and Tibet, each seeking to participate in Nalanda’s thriving scholarly debates. Nalanda was also the site of various theological debates within Buddhism, from the philosophical Nagarjuna to the esoteric tantric school of Vajrayana.</Text>

According to legend, when the general finally discovered the treasures of Nalanda, he was shocked to discover they were books. He sought those who could tell him the meaning of the texts, but they had all been slaughtered.

An outside voice – from the gods or the future – could be a good way to think through difficult choices and weigh the consequences.

These structures were raised around 2560 BCE, meaning that Cleopatra lived closer to us than she did the construction of the Pyramids. Traditional Egyptian tombs (mastabas) were long, low stone structures atop a deep burial shaft. Pyramids evolved as architects stacked these shapes, making larger and taller mastabas. Later architects, such as the alleged architect of the Great Pyramid, Hemiunu, covered these stacks in a sheath of reflective limestone and placed a capstone on top. Some have claimed the capstone was composed of gold, but that is unlikely as it would have been too great a temptation for thieves.</Text>

Teotihuacan served as a blueprint for the majesty of the Maya (who were contemporaries) and the Aztecs (who came much later). Teotihuacan's societal influence on art and trade was so strong that some scholars speculate that its decline, rather than environmental factors, led to the decline of the Maya. Teotihuacan civilization appears to have collapsed from within, likely due to social revolt and unrest. Still, their legacy remains.</Text>

Built in the third century BCE, the massive complex at Sanchi is the most impressive. A stupa is a mound of stone, allegedly containing a buried relic – the most famous contain the cremated remains of the Buddha. One can think of a stupa as a radio antenna, broadcasting the truth of the Dharma to those who listen. However, a stupa is one part of a larger temple, with houses for monks and novices, and can be understood as a place for community gatherings and education.</Text>

Sanchi’s impressive gate is a marker of the stories of the Jātaka, the lives of the Buddha before he was reborn as Siddhartha Gautama.

These schools emphasized debate and philosophy as well as a close relationship between teachers and students – a tradition exported to Persia under Alexander’s conquests.

An altar is the meeting point between these two worlds, where offerings or other signs of respect are given. These were often sites of immolation, where food or other earthly goods were set as burnt offerings and transformed into divine smoke and ash. Catholic altars are the sites where bread and wine become divine flesh and blood, and Buddhist altars carry burnt incense before images of the Enlightened One. Not all religions have altars. For example, mosques do not, which is unsurprising for a religion that privileges the written word over the material.

			<Text>Travel and innovation go hand in hand. Since ancient times, the development of bridges demonstrates the wide variety of technological and stylistic advances that have transformed these structures over the centuries. The earliest bridges drew from the immediate natural world – stepping stones and fallen trees. But people also experimented with materials to create unique solutions to natural barriers. The Obersee in Switzerland bears evidence of prehistoric log pilings that supported a wooden footbridge across the lake. In Greece, the Arkadiko Bridge features stones forming a slim arch over a ditch. The Andes and the Himalayas both saw the independent development of suspension bridges made of vines, allowing navigation of steep mountain valleys. In a more creative endeavor, Herodotus tells us that Xerxes constructed a bridge out of ships to move his army across the Hellespont strait; when a storm destroyed his first attempt, he had the sea whipped and branded with hot irons out of fury.</Text>

			<Text>The Romans loved the art of war. Gladiatorial contests included bloody duels fought between trained (and at times untrained) warriors, chariot races, and even naval battles. These events were a central feature of entertainment in the Republic and Empire. Stages developed from simple fights in an amphitheater to the massive spectacles of the Colosseum.

In many ancient and medieval armies, soldiers would be called to fight from their homes and had to camp as they saw fit, but professional armies featured soldiers who lived in the military. Elite units, or guards stationed in fortifications far from home, might be housed in special buildings from which they could easily muster for combat or training. Barracks also allowed commanders to keep an eye on their forces, ensuring discipline and readiness for the battles to come.</Text>

Those with children understand the level of humanity's filth, intimately. But societies idealize the perfect body, one fresh and clean. As a result, baths become important as sites for ritual, recreational, or daily purification. The Great Bath at Mohenjo-Daro is one such site: a massive well-fed pool in modern-day Pakistan. We have yet to decipher this society's script, so the details are lost, but this was evidently a pool for washing human bodies (whether common or noble). Likewise, Roman baths were places for relaxation and conversation, and Japanese onsen were key destinations for a relaxing weekend, especially during industrial times. Baths required detailed knowledge of plumbing, pumping, and people skilled in evaluating different geothermal sources of water – not to mention all the materials needed to purge the human body of its dirt, physical, mental, or spiritual.</Text>

Such technologies necessitated centers, places where boats could dock and unload their harvests, as well as repair and store watercraft.

Ashurbanipal could "tour" his conquests by walking through these foreign landscapes.

			<Text>The origin of cereal agriculture was a key point in the development of urban life. Cereal grains such as wheat, maize, rice, and the like require a great deal of coordinated agricultural labor, intense at times and passive during others. Some scholars, like James Scott, cite the cultivation of grain as a key point for inequality, as a gateway for slavery and serfdom (though this is contested by others, such as David Graeber). When grain is harvested en masse, it needs to be stored to last until the seasons when there is no harvest. Furthermore, it needs to be protected against mice and other pests, and be kept high and dry so it does not spoil. Hence, the granary: a storehouse to keep grain safe and secure. Early granaries date back to the Neolithic, well before the scope of this game, and are found worldwide. Examples include wooden rice storage in Southeast Asia, stone structures amongst the Pueblo people of North America, ceramic structures in the Middle East, and simple pits in Egypt.</Text>

Knowing one's location, especially at night, was a matter of literal life or death for sailors, so lighthouses lit by massive bonfires were one way early societies marked dangerous (or popular) places. While Alexandria likely has the most famous lighthouse of the ancient world, the Romans built beacons across Europe at places such as the Tower of Hercules in Spain, and other societies lit beacons on the shores.

Prosperity allowed some people to specialize in tasks – a weaver could make cloth all day and not have to worry about tilling a field. However, exchanging these goods, especially over long distances, required a central location: a market (i.e. agora, souk, bazaar).

Monuments provide a template for the public's reading of the past, normally created by those in power. For instance, Trajan’s Column, completed in 113 CE, depicts a benevolent Roman army moving towards a hostile foreign power and the subsequent rebuilding of the conquered lands; the message is that the army acted with goodwill, an important message for a public wary of a Roman military constantly set to seize power. Monuments erected in the 1920s across the American South purported to mourn the loss of the Civil War, but they contained a subtext about the continuing influence of white supremacy in the region. Monuments can also be read against the grain: Bangkok’s Democracy Monument was built by a fascist architect to celebrate a military regime, but these days it is a focal point for pro-democratic rallies.

In ancient times, productivity often translated to power. Estates, large or small, acted like near-states in themselves, and could house plantations, industries, labor staff, and even personal guards. In Rome, these estates were villas, palatial residences surrounded by a variety of productions. Villas could become threats to centralized power, as production led to wealth, wealth led to influence, and influence could lay claim to power. Roman villas were divided into country and suburban residences and could reach the size of the latifundia, large estates with masses of working enslaved people.

Due to its strong defenses, the acropolis often housed the city’s treasury, as well as the residence of its leader. In peacetime, it was a center for religion and society. Temples were raised to the gods, rituals and festivals were held within its walls, and cultural events such as theatrical and musical performances attracted locals and tourists alike.</Text>

			<Text>While each major city featured an acropolis, the most famous remains that of Athens. Around its base lay the Odeon and the Theater of Dionysus; at its summit, amid temples and shrines, sat the Parthenon and an immense statue of the goddess Athena, surveying her namesake city.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_QUARTER_FORUM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The forum was the heart of Roman life, providing a communal center for the populace and drawing a settlement’s most important services – social, religious, economic, and cultural – into a single location. These public spaces began as commercial hubs, marketplaces that served multiple towns and drew them into a single political entity. They were also social centers for locals to gather and meet. Over time, these fora grew to incorporate additional functions. They housed the Temple of Jupiter and additional religious complexes and shrines. Political speeches and debates often took place on the steps of these buildings, while nearby basilicas bustled with legal matters and business transactions. During the Republic, the forum in Rome expanded in both scope and monumental architecture and became one of the city’s major tourist attractions, as well as the model for fora throughout the Roman world.</Text>

			<Text>A temple is often more than simply a temple. As Hindu and Jain temples grow larger, they fulfill more social functions and integrate into the community, becoming not only places of worship, but ones that offer services to all branches of society. Here, religious scholars are provided texts, technologies (e.g. medicine, sculpture, dance) are taught and studied, and the indigent or impoverished can receive help; temples may also function as communally-run spaces for agriculture and production. In the past, such places operated as a safety net in times of need, adding a human face to a world that, with wars and epidemics, disasters and uncertainty, could be harsh. These activities speak to the importance of working for the public good, and they occupy areas often managed by the state in the modern era. For example, universities, hospitals, and social welfare have become secularized today but were seen as a duty of religion in the past.</Text>

			<Text>According to ancient Egyptians, true immortality was found in death, but significant preparation was required to achieve the best outcome in the afterlife. The necropolis (“city of the dead”) developed to support and serve the extensive funerary practices that prepared body and soul for their final journey. Upon death, Egyptians believed the soul departed the body, which needed to be preserved until the spirit’s return allowed for rebirth. This process was accomplished through mummification, during which the organs were removed and the corpse was dried out, treated, and wrapped in linen before being interred in a sarcophagus. The dead were buried with spells to guide them to the afterlife, as well as food, tools, treasures, and other supplies they would need for the journey.</Text>

			<Text>Numerous dangerous paths traversed the Duat, or underworld, and the passage taken by the deceased was determined by their status in life. If the soul succeeded in this voyage, it faced judgment and was weighed against the feather of Ma’at to determine if it was pure enough to enter Sekhet-Aaru, the paradisial Field of Reeds. Those who passed the test would find new life…those who failed were consumed by the goddess Ammit, never to be reborn.</Text>

			<Text>The Maya godhouse – the uwaybil k’uh – was a place of veneration for the Maya deities. Temples were houses for the gods, places where the deities could rest and be at home. As such, they were often covered by a cloth, at once enhancing the familiarity of the place (i.e. its appearance as a place of rest and relaxation) as well as its otherworldliness (i.e. this place of rest was intended for a divine being). These coverings were located in the innermost sanctum of a Maya temple, a place closed off to all but the most high-ranking priests. As such they emphasized the temples as places of religious veneration, not communal activity. In other words, the idea that religious rites are moments that bring a community together (a theory of Émile Durkheim) is contradicted here. These were places where individuals could perform the necessary duties that ensure the cooperation and placation of the vital forces underpinning the universe in seclusion.</Text>
