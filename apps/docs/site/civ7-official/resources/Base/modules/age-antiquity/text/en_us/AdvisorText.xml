			<Text>Our greatest minds have produced a new Codex, but what use is wisdom that none can see? I suggest building a Library or Academy and moving the Codex there, so that all can benefit from it.</Text>

			<Text>Our rivals in {2_CivName} have plans drawn up and work begun on the World Wonder {3_ConstructibleName} â€” the very same as what we're building in {1_CityName}. They say hard work is its own reward, but let's try for a Wonder, too.</Text>

			<Text>You have over 1000 Gold in your treasury. Money exists to be spent, so it can make more money. I'd suggest purchasing a building in one of our Cities or Towns. New construction means bigger cities, happier people, and more Gold.</Text>

			<Text>Our settlement of {1_CityName} is overrun, conquered by the forces of {2_LeaderName}. Such a loss must be repaid on the battlefield. If we strengthen our armies, we can better defend the empire. The loss of all our settlements would knock us out of the game.</Text>

In addition to the amount of Units our Army Commanders can hold, we will only be able to maintain {1_value} Land Units at the start of the next Age, and only Infantry, Ranged and Cavalry Units. Without more Army Commanders, we will lose {2_lostunits} Land {2_lostunits: plural 1?Unit; other?Units;} when the Age ends.</Text>
