			<Text>The ancient Mediterranean world featured arteries of trade extending from Rome to China (in later years, and through different routes, this would become the Silk Road). On the southern end of this route was the kingdom of Aksum, cited by the prophet Mani as one of the great powers of the world, alongside Rome, China, and Persia. Aksum believed it was the inheritor of Kush, or Nubia, which was called Ethiopia by the Greeks. This was the upper part of the Nile River (now known as the southern part, which is confusing if you’re looking at a map but makes sense if you’re sailing the river). This kingdom had its own language, culture, and identity that was linked deeply with Egypt. Kush traded with Egypt and was subjugated by them, but at times ruled over the entire Nile. Aksum bridged the Red Sea and controlled trade routes linking Africa to India, leaving the Mediterranean proper to Greek and Roman powers.</Text>

			<Text>Life at either end of this trade route had its advantages. If Aksum and Rome kept their frontiers fortified, they could profit from trade without being trampled by the armies that crossed over Persia and India. The list of goods Aksum traded is impressive: rhino horn, ivory, and all manner of products  from the African interior. Given its position at the mouth of the Red Sea, Aksum was well poised to capitalize on trade between India and Roman-controlled Egypt, especially when merchants wanted to bypass Syria and other potential Persian possessions.</Text>

			<Text>This kingdom also anticipated later Christian Ethiopian realms. While the Aksumites originally practiced their own polytheistic religion, one king captured a Christian boy from Tyre called Frumentius. Frumentius remained in Aksum to educate the imperial heir, Ezana, whom he later converted to Christianity. Ezana’s conversion was likely motivated by the promise of stronger trading ties with the Mediterranean, particularly the Roman Empire, through shared religion. In addition to Christianity, modern-day Ethiopians trace their script, Ge’ez, back to Aksum, although it is debated how much of Aksumite culture was Arabic in origin and how much was from sub-Saharan Africa.</Text>

			<Text>Aksum’s days were numbered as Muslim caliphates rose in the seventh century CE. The expanding Arab powers not only threatened Aksumite possessions in Yemen, but the Muslim conquest of Egypt and the establishment of trade empires based on religious connections meant that Aksum’s culture-defining trade routes went nowhere under Ethiopian rule. Unwilling to convert this time, the Aksumite kings faded into the introverted Ethiopian dynasties of the medieval period.</Text>

			<Text>While Aksum laid the foundations for modern-day Ethiopia, one wonders about an Ethiopia that could have been. If Aksum had maintained an open link with Byzantium, the fortunes of the eastern Mediterranean and general Orthodoxy might be different. One could imagine an Orthodox sphere of power extending south to the Swahili coast, stretching from Constantinople to present-day Kenya. But that was not to be, and once Aksum was cut off, it faded.</Text>

			<Text>But “faded” might not be the best term as historical records cite a 10th century invasion of Aksum, either by a Jewish queen named Gudit or by a queen from southern lands (i.e. Kenya). Some kind of military action occurred in the region, but allegations pointing to non-Christians should be taken a grain of salt, given the prejudices of that era. Other sources suggest that a brief centuries-long rainy period ended, reverting Ethiopia to its drier roots and hurting the Aksumite food base. As a power in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia would rise again, but this time as the master of the highlands and not the Red Sea. Still, this is a story of another time, a time of the Battle of Adwa, the rock-hewn churches of the hills, of resistance to colonialism (and internal colonization).</Text>

			<Text>Any text on early civilization is likely to evoke Egypt. The notion of time regarding Egyptian history is astounding. For instance, the Great Pyramid of Giza was already 2,600 years old by the time of the Roman Empire – meaning Cleopatra and Caesar were closer to our own time than those who laid the Pyramids' stones. Even two millennia after the Pyramids’ construction, the Egyptian kingdom still flourished, and the names of its gods Horus and Amun-Ra were still spoken. Will we say the same for our civilization two thousand years hence?</Text>

			<Text>To its inhabitants, Egypt was Kemet, the Black Land. Its modern name (Egypt) comes from the Greek “Aegyptos.” The link between the kingdom and the “black land” points to Egypt’s dependence on the Nile River. During the yearly flood, waters rise to a certain level, carrying rich silt and moisture onto the desolate Saharan ground. The line between black alluvial soil and unfertile, red soil underlines how the Egyptians viewed themselves – the rich, black land as opposed to the red desolation. Indeed, this dependence on the Nile resounds throughout Egyptian mythology; Ra, the god of the sun, shines upon the gifts of Hapi, the god/dess of the Nile’s flood, and Horus, the god of kings, rules over that. Life, death, and rebirth exist in an endless cycle that is both ever-changing and timeless.</Text>

			<Text>The ethnic origins of the Egyptians has been a politically fraught question for some time.

			<Text>To cover Egypt's history, we have to speak of very different times, nearly 7000 years ago. Egypt changed a lot during that period. Petroglyphs across the Sahara region reveal a different climate – one that is lusher than the present, where parts of the desert functioned more like a savannah. The Neolithic peoples who settled Egypt were master farmers and traders, importing obsidian micro-blades from Ethiopia to use in early sickles, making use of the rich Egyptian soil. After the Sahara dried, Neolithic people started to form communities in the fertile river valleys, centered around the mass production of grain. People developed bronzeworking (combining copper with tin or arsenic) to make tools (iron did not arrive until Roman times).</Text>

			<Text>Religion suffused Egypt. Vitality came from the land, from the river (embodied in Hapi, the god of the flood), the pharaoh regnant (embodied in Horus), the light of the sun (embodied in Amun-Ra), the judgment of the dead (by the scales of Anubis), and the resurrection of the pharaoh (as Osiris, the reborn god). As with any religious system that spans thousands of years, differences emerge: Osiris did not become a significant deity until the Middle Kingdom and later pharaohs experimented with new divinities and even monotheism (Akhenaten sought to implement a monotheist worship of the god Aten).</Text>

			<Text>Egypt's written history begins around 5000 years ago with Menes, which aptly means “he who endures.” According to myth, Menes accepted the crown directly from the falcon-headed god Horus. This was still not the centralized Old Kingdom of pyramids and sphinxes – for that, one has to advance another half-century to the reign of Djoser, the likely founder of the Old Kingdom. Djoser (or more likely his vizier Imhotep) piled stone mastaba tombs one upon another, beginning the tradition of pyramid-building, which would see its height during the reign of later pharaohs. Khufu was paramount among these rulers as he was the builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza. The Old Kingdom fell around 2100 BCE, for reasons that may have been political, environmental, or both. Regardless, a period of de-centralization followed.</Text>

			<Text>In these “intermediate periods,” Egypt seemed to decline, but this was simply a decline of kings as the Egyptian people likely went back to some kind of municipal rule, focusing the kingdom’s colossal powers on improving the lives of living subjects rather than the ambitions of rebirth for its elite.</Text>

			<Text>The most jarring split may have come during the invasion of the Hyksos, a people from the Near East who established a foreign dynasty during the Middle Kingdom. But within a few generations, the Hyksos had adopted Egyptian culture to the point that the invaders became indistinguishable from the invaded. During the New Kingdom (1550-1070 BCE), Egypt's might peaked. At this point, pyramid-building had long since passed, but the massive architecture of Ramses eclipsed these structures. The statues of the god-king in Thebes and Memphis displayed the magnificence and wealth of the time, which continued into the reign of Ramses' descendant, the pharaoh-queen Hatshepsut. </Text>

			<Text>This was the last golden age of a kingdom that had shone brightly for a long time. In later years, powers such as Assyria, Persia, and eventually Greece and Rome, conquered Egypt. However, the region was never a backwater and became one of the most prized possessions for any Empire, largely owing to its rich grain sources. When Rome took the region, its riches flowed directly into imperial coffers, making figures like Augustus wealthy in ways they could not achieve from European land holdings alone. Around 640 CE, the Rashidun Caliphate made the final end to ancient Egypt, although centuries of Roman, Greek, and Byzantine rule had already altered it. Today, Egypt remains one of the most iconic empires of the ancient world, its immense ruins a testament to the legacy and ingenuity of its people. </Text>

			<Text>Unlike Rome and Egypt, Greece was only rarely a unified polity. Instead, it was composed of a series of independent city-states (poleis) that shared a common cultural and linguistic heritage and sometimes allied in leagues or clashed in bitter wars. Greece only existed as an empire under Alexander. As a shared template of cultural and technological patterns, Greece created one of the bright spots of thought and creativity in the ancient world. Important regions in ancient Greece, such as Halicarnassus, Syracuse, Thrace, and Macedon, are now parts of neighboring, modern-day countries (e.g., Italy, Turkey, and North Macedonia).</Text>

			<Text>Homer’s Greece is perhaps the most famous – the world of the Odyssey and the Iliad, of the cyclops and the Trojan Horse. These tales come from before recorded history, during the archaic period, around 2800 years ago. Compared to other civilizations, this is not so old; at the Iliad’s composition, the Pyramids of Giza were already nearing 2000 years old. This is the period of the oldest Greek writing, a period when states were exploring novel political formations: tyranny (the seizure of power by unconventional means), total mobilization (e.g. the Spartan war machine), and democracy. These were variations on older themes. Athens may have written about democracy, but it certainly wasn't the first democratic government (nor would its system be recognized as a true democracy by modern politicians).</Text>

			<Text>The fifth century BCE was the height of Greek civilization. After Persia's dramatic failed invasion of Greece – which included the naval battle at Salamis and the famous episode where 300 Spartan soldiers withstood the Persian army at Thermopylae – Greece began to flourish. Scholars such as the historian Herodotus and the philosophers Plato and Socrates charted the political systems of the world and debated the nature of consciousness, reality, and the ideal forms of the state. These proved inspirational for present-day philosophy. Indeed, even words such as philosophy itself stem from this time (the Greek “philosophia” means “love of wisdom”).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_GREECE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>However, this was not a period of peace. Athens and other city-states fought wars against threats both foreign and domestic. Sparta and Athens, with their radically different outlooks on life and the state, warred for dominance while Carthage and other neighbors posed a constant threat. By the fourth century BCE, the Greek peninsula was exhausted by constant battle. The northern power of Macedon was not. Alexander the Great rose from Macedonia to lead a united Greece on a world-spanning conquest that extended the empire's borders to India and beyond (but not westward into nascent Rome). After he divided his realm between his generals, however, this united Greece quickly fell into disunity and its successor states soon fell to other powers. The mainland was subsumed in 146 BCE by its western neighbor, Rome.</Text>

This is unsurprising as Greek and Sanskrit shared certain vocabularies, Greek and Indian myths about thunder-throwing god kings (Indra or Zeus) often overlap, and their heroic folk tales about quests to win back a stolen bride (Sita or Helen) share some similarities. Danish traders, centuries before the Viking Age, sailed down the Rhine to do business with Greek merchants, and Greek markets carried goods across the Red Sea.</Text>

			<Text>In the fertile river valleys of the eastern coast of the Asian continent, a new power emerged around 1000 BCE. Our first clear glimpse of China was with the Zhou Dynasty: a series of powerful military states. Each of these states vied to become the hegemon, the protector of the emperor who was lord of the symbolically powerful yet militarily weak Zhou state. Maintaining imperial authority over a military power was a tricky balance – the final era of this dynasty wasn’t called “Warring States” for no reason. Different states employed different strategies: compromising, growing large and ethnically diverse (Chu), or becoming rigid and martial (Qin). As any who has heard the name Qin Shi Huang could guess, the Qin won out, largely through military mobilization and a basic but effective strategy of making alliances with distant powers.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_HAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>However, the Qin were poor protectors. They overthrew the Zhou emperor and embarked on a forward-thinking, martial expansion that frightened other Chinese states. Despite Qin Shi Huang’s claims that he would be a universal, timeless monarch, death eventually came for him. The Qin had claimed they were the new, martial future for Chinese civilization, but the other Chinese states put a stop to that. A new era of warring states emerged, split between the Chu state and the Han state. Under the emperor Gaozu, the Han emerged from the Qin’s ashes in 202 BCE and sought to combine Qin efficiency with Zhou legitimacy. </Text>

To put a very significant roadblock in the Xiongnu's path and to control westward trade, the Han began constructing the Great Wall. At the time, the structure was largely composed of rammed earth. The Han also expanded trade networks beyond its borders, reaching across Eurasia all the way to Rome.</Text>

Modernist policies were future-oriented and expansionist.</Text>

The reformists (associated with Confucian bureaucrats) argued that expansion had gone far enough and pointed back to traditional values, roles, and the Zhou for inspiration on how to govern. Memories of Qin Shi Huang’s harsh rule were still fresh for many and this tension resulted in a civil war. By some estimates, this conflict destroyed half of China’s population and resulted in the capital moving from Chang’an to Luoyang (the former Zhou capital). At this time, areas only loosely occupied by the Han – namely Korea and Vietnam – turned to rebellion. The Trung sisters led the revolt in Vietnam, and while this independence was short-lived, it remains an important part of Vietnamese history today. </Text>

A powerful usurper might use a foreign ideology as a new basis for power, often with a claim to (Hindu) divinity. The narratives surrounding these divine kingdoms were often fusions of local and global folklore – a common origin myth (Khmer included) involved the marriage of a Brahman king to a naga (water dragon), thus uniting foreign/male power to local/common axes, laying the groundwork for a divine monarchy.</Text>

For these people, things always seem to just work out, but they also behave in a way that attracts these qualities.

The capital is built to look like the heavens and the lesser cities are built to look like the capital. This divine organization means that divine power can manifest on earth. In turn, lesser cities far flung from Angkor look like mini-Angkors, with their own mini-kings.

Both versions of Buddhism are an outgrowth of Hinduism, and all three respect the Hindu gods. In Cambodia, Hinduism was a cult of the monarch as divinity on earth, with Brahmans as attendants. Mahayana Buddhism was similar but had an emphasis on philosophy coming from India. Theravada Buddhism focuses on universal literacy and mobilization of the populace.

Some lesser sons simply sought to break away and provided legitimacy for new dynasties in new eras.

Early studies posited that the Maya were a peaceful, priestly society. The American New Age movement had a notion that Maya cities were merely temples and sites for astronomy that rose out of the jungle. This is profoundly incorrect; LIDAR and earlier studies have revealed dense networks of canals and cultivated zones that extended around cities. Furthermore, cities were not at all peaceful.

Maya cities rarely depended on rivers as they were built atop the large natural aquifer of the Yucatan peninsula, which was useful for preventing the spread of water-borne disease and provided ubiquitous sources of fresh water across the forest but was also vulnerable to changing climates. During a drought, a river might slow to a trickle, but some form of stream will remain. On the other hand, when underground sources of water dry up, they dry up everywhere. </Text>

			<Text>In the late first millennium CE and the early second, the Mississippian society stretched from Louisiana to Michigan, and from east Texas to the South Carolina Atlantic. These people were called Mississippians largely on account of the river that ran through their center. Archaeologically speaking, they were a culture, meaning they had commonalities in land use, architecture, pottery, and other tools. However, since the Mississippians lacked a system of writing, our understanding of their culture is missing details: whether or not the group was united or divided, the names of its famous people, and the specific meanings of its symbols and legends. The archaeological imprint of violence (or the lack of it), the movement of goods, and shared iconography suggest political structures and reveal trade routes. Still, several questions remain: were city-states politically unified? Did they all speak the same language? Does the evidence for large public ball games in North America point to the same institution from Maya sites? Archaeologists can make educated guesses, but they are only educated guesses.</Text>

			<Text>The Mississippians grew out of what archaeologists call the late Woodland period (1000 BCE-1000 CE). During this time, people in this region steadily increased the use of stone and bone technologies, and invented tools like blowguns and the bow (they had previously used spear-like atlatls). Over time, hunting groups developed pottery and agriculture (gourds and maize), though hunted deer remained important. Copper mining in the region began as early as 3000 BCE. Most copperworking involved manually bending the metal until it became warm enough to be pliable, and then riveting it to other sheets. Copper and brass were mostly used for ornamentation, although some tools and weapons were fashioned out of copper.</Text>

			<Text>Around 800 CE, increasing sedentarism consolidated into permanent cities, the largest of which was Cahokia. Prior interpretations of Cahokia placed it at the center of trade routes directly controlled by rulers. But later evidence points to its role as the center of a more indirect empire, what archaeologists call a “paramount chiefdom,” in which rulers lead via influence and networks, rather than direct administration. A paramount chiefdom consists of a series of noble families; a chief comes from the upper levels of those families. This system of rule could be complicated by succession laws or election – it’s impossible to tell. Further, it seems that Mississippian systems were cyclical; nobles from different cities rose to power at different times. In short, this was a region with a high degree of political instability and social fluidity. Cahokian society revolved around class divisions and the appropriation of surplus production, though people who lived lower on the social scale probably lived communally.</Text>

			<Text>One key feature of Mississippian society was the construction of elaborate mounds. These were built in different ways across the region, as pyramids and platform mounds that housed various structures. In larger, centralized areas they were built annually, but on the outskirts, they would be constructed irregularly (likely according to life cycles or in moments interregnum – at the death or ascension of a chief). Even at the smaller level, cities were fortified with palisades and featured elaborate systems of festivals during which lesser cities sent tribute (deer forelimbs, maize, or prestige goods like copper plates) to their paramount chieftain. Additionally, Mississippians operated extensive trade networks, ranging from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic to the Rockies. They also adopted an artistic system called the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, which included lacrosse and other versions of the ball game (called “chunkey” in 17th century Cahokia).</Text>

			<Text>After white explorers found mounds in the Midwest, several rumors flourished. Some highly religious 19th-century Americans believed the Lost Tribes of Israel must have been behind the mounds' formations because they couldn’t get their heads around the idea that they'd been built by ancestors of the people they despised (who also seemed weak in the wake of war and disease). This led to a belief in lost civilizations in the American interior and became linked to popular notions of Atlantis. Needless to say, such speculation is unfounded, not to mention harmful in that it led to the disparagement and dispossession of present-day descendants of the Mississippians. The truth is that the Mississippians were the ancestors of many tribes in the area, namely: the Alabama, Apalachee, Caddo, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee Creek, Guale, Hitchiti, Houma, Kansa, Missouria, Mobilian, Natchez, Osage, Quapaw, Seminole, Tunica-Biloxi, Yamasee, and Yuchi. </Text>

However, the story about a recognizable Iranian people begins with the fall of the great Mesopotamian powers – namely Assyria.

The Greek states were too weak to take on Persia themselves, so the independent Athens helped fund the rebellion of these Aegean states. Persia ultimately regained control of these territories, but later Achaemenid kings, such as Darius (522-486) and Xerxes (486-465), would remember this insult. Xerxes led a massive force into Greece, easily taking most of the northern territories, but fought to a humiliating standstill at Thermopylae, where a force of thousands of Greeks delayed a Persian army fifty times their size. The most dramatic claim was that a force of 7,000 Greeks held out against three million Persians, but these numbers are likely vastly inflated.

The quasi-mythical Roman monarchy gave way to the decidedly historical Republic. The Republic worked thanks to its Senate. Senators were appointed by locally-elected officials (selected from the patrician class), and debated domestic policy while legislative assemblies of full citizens (a minority) debated foreign policy and other matters.
