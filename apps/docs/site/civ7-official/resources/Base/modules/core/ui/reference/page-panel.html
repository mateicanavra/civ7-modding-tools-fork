			<p>Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking,
				that
				probably isn't a name. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. Oh, I always rip
				out
				the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Please tell me I didn't get old.
				Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and
				poke it with a stick. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! You are the only mystery worth solving.</p>
