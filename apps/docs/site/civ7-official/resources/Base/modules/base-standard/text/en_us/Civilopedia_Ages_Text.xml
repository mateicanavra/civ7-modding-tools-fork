		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>Ages and Age Transition are new to Civilization VII and represent large segments of human history, culture, and conflict. A full game in Civilization VII spans multiple Ages, as players play from one Age to the next. A game ends when any player wins a Victory.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Each Age has a set of challenges and rewards called Legacy Paths. Players can complete Milestones on a Legacy path to unlock powerful bonuses that can carry into the next Age (called Legacies). Players can also unlock additional playable Civilizations for the next age depending what they do in the current age.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">
			<Text>When an Age ends, all players transition to the next age at the same time. An Age ends when the Age Progress Meter is filled. Age Progress is added slowly every turn but also advances more quickly when a player accomplishes a Milestone for the first time, researches a Future Tech or Civic, or when a player is eliminated. Once the meter is at 95% (on Standard Speed), Age Progress cannot be added through normal means and a 10 turn countdown will begin. Each turn will add 1 Age Progress until the meter is full and the Age ends.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_4">
			<Text>During Age transition, Players choose a new Civilization to play as and gain powerful bonuses from any Legacies unlocked in the previous Age. Players gain more Legacy points to spend on Legacies as well as unique Legacies by completing all Milestones on a Legacy Path. During this time, Mementos can also be changed. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_5">
			<Text>If an Age is not the last Age of a Campaign, a Crisis can trigger when the Age Progress Meter is almost full. Crises are major events that usher in the end of an Age and are not intended to be solved or stopped.</Text>

			<Text>Carry over between Ages: Military</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_39_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>When playing with the Regroup Age Transition Impact option, Military units partially reset at the end of each Age. Naval units are lost after Antiquity, although you gain a free Cog upon starting the Exploration Age if you have spent your Legacy Points. Keeping naval units beyond the Exploration Age requires Fleet Commanders. Land units are capped at six after the Antiquity Age and nine after the Exploration Age, plus any assigned to an Army Commander. Surplus units above those limits are disbanded, and if you have fewer than the minimum, you receive free Infantry to make up the difference.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_39_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">

A cap of 3000 Gold and 500 Influence carries over in each Age, but both values are scaled by game speed. Buildings from older Ages become less effective, losing adjacency while retaining only base yields. Only the Capital remains a City; all others revert to Towns, though you can relocate your Capital to spawn a second City immediately. Most Techs and Civics reset, as do civilian units, while old Civ abilities expire (unique buildings and improvements remain). Legacy Points not used at the Age start are lost.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_3_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Players also start the Age with the Social policies of a Civilization of the previous age. This Civilization will be one of the recommended Civilizations of a Player’s chosen Leader.</Text>

			<Text>Golden Age and Dark Age Legacies</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_7_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>When a Player completes the final Milestone of a Legacy Path, they unlock a Golden Age Legacy. Golden Age Legacies allow Players to keep more of their Civilization intact after an Age transition. For example, some Golden Age Legacies allow a player to keep a specific type of Building into the next Age with its Yields and bonuses. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_7_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>In contrast, Dark Age Legacies are unlocked by default. If a Player choses a Dark Age Legacy, they will receive powerful bonuses in the next age at the cost of also applying negative effects. For example, a Dark Age Legacy may make it easier to research specific Techs, but at the cost of increasing how long it takes to produce a specific Unit.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_7_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">

			<Text>Domination Victory</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_11_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_11_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>A Domination Victory is possible at any time during the Exploration and Modern Ages. In the Antiquity Age, a Domination Victory is only possible when playing a Single Age Game.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_14_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Crises push Players to deal with escalating negative events, ranging from hostile invaders, spreading plagues, or open rebellion from settlements. During a Crisis, Players must slot Crisis Social Policies. These policies reflect how your civilization is choosing to manage the Crisis and often have negative effects that will last until the end of this Age.	</Text>

			<Text>Plagues</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_17_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>Plagues are a special type of disaster associated with Crises.  Plagues can be Major Outbreaks or Minor Outbreaks.  Major Outbreaks spread and cause Minor Outbreaks in Connected settlements.  Outbreaks are more likely to occur in settlements that are densely populated, highly connected to trade routes or under siege.  Outbreaks pillage Buildings and Improvements in a settlement but also sometimes give additional science or culture to an affected tile.  Units on an infected tile take damage every turn.</Text>

			<Text>In Antiquity, crisis policies are tied to a Civilization’s Government. If a settlement’s people are unhappy then they can go into Unrest or even Revolt and try to defect to another civilization.  Antiquity Revolt crisis policies put pressure on the happiness of a player’s settlements so make sure to increase your local happiness in key settlements with Resources and Buildings or Stationing Commanders to suppress Unhappiness.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_AGES_21_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>In Exploration, settlement revolts are tied to Happiness and Religion.  Unhappy settlements that follow another civilization’s religion can go into Unrest or even Revolt and defect to the Founder of that Religion.  Exploration crisis policies give players a choice to pursue religious tolerance and maintain a religiously diverse Civilization or to embrace religious zeal and pursue a policy of strict religious unity. You can avoid unrest and revolts either by ensuring that all of your settlements follow your religion or by keeping any settlements that don't follow your religion happy.</Text>
