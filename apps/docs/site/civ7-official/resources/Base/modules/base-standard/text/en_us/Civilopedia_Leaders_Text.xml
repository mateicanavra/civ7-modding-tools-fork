			<Text>Modern-day Nigeria is built on the foundations of multiple layers of history, ethnic groups, and configurations of city-states in the pre-colonial period. Of these, the Hausa are dominant in the northern region, and Zazzau was one of their pre-eminent states. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AMINA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>To understand the politics of West Africa, one should examine both geography and trade routes. The most notable overland routes ran through the cold Siberian steppe and the Sahara Desert, both highways linking the resources of West Africa to the wealth of Asia (with their nexus in Arabia). As with the Silk Road, Islam was the predominant religion of these networks.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AMINA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>In the 1500s, this configuration began to change with the arrival of large oceangoing ships from Portugal (and soon after, other European powers). Saharan trade started moving towards sending trade down to Portuguese and other outposts on the coast, even as North African trade routes remained focused on the Middle East. In both cases, major trade goods included cotton, indigo, salt, kola, leather, gold and those unfortunate enough to be captured and enslaved. Local kings and warlords made profits, but this influx of wealth from a variety of sources made for highly unstable societies, as everyone sought the latest and most lucrative sources of wealth.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AMINA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>Zazzau was one such city-state in northern Nigeria, a home to the Hausa people of the Sahel. Amina was the daughter of its king. In popular tradition, Amina was preternaturally gifted at combat, holding a knife as a child in the exact way a warrior would hold a sword. When her father and brother died, she took over the reign of Zazzau.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AMINA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>The idea of a Muslim warrior queen might at first seem unusual. It shouldn’t. Hausa Islam was highly syncretic, meaning that it incorporated a lot of other influences under the umbrella of “Islam” – indeed, this was a reason why war plagued the area, as reformers sought to bring religion in closer dialogue with Arabia, and others leaned on alternative, more traditional sources of authority.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AMINA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>Amina went on a series of conquests starting in 1576; her first command to her soldiers was “sharpen your weapons.” She fought for decades, so often that her warriors quickly became accomplished veterans, and she united much of the Hausa territory.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AMINA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>With conquest comes stability and trade. The union of land under Zazzau allowed Sahara-bound routes to remain open and viable, even as the more coastal settlements turned towards expanding European presences. However, those trade routes were to prove Amina’s undoing, at least in terms of her legacy. As Hausaland became increasingly linked with conservative Islam, the concept of warrior queens faded, and official roles for women were diminished, a trend that persisted after British colonization. But today, in a postcolonial Nigeria and especially in Hausaland, Amina’s legend continues, and she has become a national hero.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AMINA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8">
			<Text>Amina’s conquests involved the militarization of much of the Nigerian Sahel and the fortification of Hausa cities and towns. The most colorful legend stemming from her conquests claims that she took a lover in every city she conquered, and then killed the man the morning after – a sure way to preserve one’s independence and legacy.</Text>

			<Text>In the immediate aftermath of Alexander the Great’s failed conquest of India, the Mauryan Empire rose to become the largest single polity to emerge in India in antiquity. After Alexander’s retreat, Chandragupta Maurya seized the chaos that followed and conquered the vassals that Greece had left behind. Though less unified than later Indian empires, Maurya was a beacon for learning and culture, even sending emissaries and Buddhist missionaries westward, in Alexander’s footsteps. Domestically, the empire continued the maintenance of trade routes across the subcontinent, from east to west, forming a key link in the Silk Road, a route that was to become central to their fame. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_ASHOKA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Religion played a vital role in Maurya. India is home to many of the world’s religions – Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, as well as a few more exotic strands of belief, such as Greek Hellenism. The early Mauryans were Jain, whose focus on non-violence and the cultivation of personal purity seems an odd choice for an emperor – until one realizes that purity in turn leads to personal power and charisma. It should be noted that the Mauryans regularly had both Chinese and Greek visitors rubbing shoulders in its cities, resulting in significant heterogeneity and cosmopolitanism. </Text>

			<Text>Ashoka (Asoka) – the name means “without sorrow” – started life as the unfavored last-born son. Apparently, his father simply did not like his complexion, which was not smooth like his brothers, and repeatedly ignored the signs that this child was going to become a conqueror. When his brother, the crown prince, headed off to war, Ashoka declared that the gods wished him to be the king. Few stood in the way of this claim: when Ashoka’s father protested, the old man promptly died; and when Ashoka’s brother returned to seize the throne, he was promptly dumped into a charcoal fire. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_ASHOKA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>Once established, Ashoka continued his rather bloody rise to power. He immediately placed his sights on the Kalinga Empire to the east and launched a war of brazen conquest. Eager for victory, Ashoka rode out to battle with his troops – and was disgusted. The bloodshed and brutality he witnessed there led him to renounce violence and embrace Buddhism and the effort to spread the truth of the dharma (Buddhist teachings) across the kingdom, which he did by erecting stelae extolling the dharma across Mauryan lands.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_ASHOKA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>On his stelae, Ashoka issued his Edicts. In addition to listing those responsible for inscribing them, the Edicts define prohibitions on immorality – violence towards animals (i.e. meat-eating), violence towards people, and overly licentious festivals. They also describe institutions (of medical care, for instance) that the emperor set up in the region, making a lasting claim towards global goodwill.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_ASHOKA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>Ashoka’s story is one of transformation. A visiting Chinese diplomat speculated that the early Ashoka had personally gone to hell to learn new methods of torture, while the later Ashoka denounces all violence, to human and animal alike. It is a story of repentance that has made Ashoka a hero across Buddhist Asia, and he is seen by many Sri Lankans and Southeast Asians as the person who brought Buddhism to their parts of the world. While this impact is perhaps his most lasting legacy worldwide, Ashoka remains compelling to Indians as well, and was the subject of a big-budget Bollywood feature and, now, a popular TV series. </Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Where to begin with Caesar Augustus, about whom massive volumes of text have been written, and to whom nearly every subsequent “great leader” west of the Indus River has aspired to be? He was Caesar from 27 BCE until 14 CE, and epitomized Rome at its height. Conceivably, he was less bold and more methodical than his great-uncle and adoptive father, Julius Caesar. However, Augustus arguably accomplished more.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Octavian, Augustus’ non-imperial name, was born into a knight’s family (eques). However, he had links to royalty, related to Julius Caesar by blood; his mother was Caesar’s niece (though Julius Caesar himself was not from the highest ranks of Roman nobility). When Octavian was a child, his father died and his mother remarried a man who was less than attentive. Octavian grew into a quiet, thoughtful, pragmatic young man. Still, he sought power and made several attempts to get closer to his famous uncle. He tried to sail to the front lines of a war that Julius Caesar was waging in Spain and was shipwrecked, yet managed to make his way through hostile territory to the front. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>This adventure greatly impressed the emperor. Caesar took a liking to the young man and quickly named him as his successor and adoptive son. Precisely why Caesar did this is open for speculation. Caesar's contemporaries, and many modern scholars, have suggested the boy was Caesar’s lover, something common in Rome, but a detail that may have opened Caesar to criticism and accusations of irrational decisions based upon lust. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>The rest of the story is famous. Julius Caesar, returning in triumph from a war in Europe, was commanded to stop before he marched the army to Rome. Fed up with the arrogance and incompetence in the senate (and their formal inquiries into his finances), Caesar made no secret about his own imperial ambitions. Jokes and rumors about Caesar as an emperor abounded in Rome, and when Caesar appeared to be coming back in triumph, the senate demanded he disband his army. Fearing his imprisonment, he refused and a war ensued. Upon Caesar’s victory, he was eventually declared dictator and embarked on a series of reforms. In the end, his enemies (and friends) in the senate murdered him.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>What followed was a massive civil war. The common people were outraged, and Caesar’s assassins fled to Greece. Caesar’s heirs and friends sought to avenge him: Marc Antony, Caesar’s cavalry commander Lepidus…and Octavian. Octavian proved a more appealing figure than Antony to the common people, as Antony initially granted amnesty to Caesar’s assassins. Furthermore, Octavian had allies in the senate who remembered and rejected Antony’s pretenses to power as well as his dismissal of Octavian’s familial ties and special relationship with Caesar.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>Even after Caesar's assassins were murdered, the political situation remained fraught. Octavian had married Antony’s wife’s daughter, but now he spurned her, so she fled to Antony seeking revenge. The three heirs split the Empire between them – Antony in the East, Octavian in the West, and Lepidus in Africa. While Antony retained supporters, his affair with, and idolization of, Cleopatra cost him allies in Rome. When Octavian opened Antony’s sealed will, revealing that he planned to divide the empire amongst his children, Antony’s fate was sealed. After a defeat, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. In the wake of their deaths, Octavian remained the sole ruler of Rome.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>Nevertheless, Octavian was cautious and ensured that his power plays were legitimated by a senate that was slowly falling under his sway. In 27 BCE, Octavian changed his name to Augustus. Another name he chose for himself was “victorious commander”: Imperator. With this title came victories: solidified control over Hispania, the Balkans, and Judea, though he also suffered a major defeat in Germany. Much of Augustus’ power as an individual came from taking personal control over the most lucrative territories – for instance, Egypt belonged to him, not Rome. The profits from that immensely wealthy area flowed into his accounts, as they would for his successors.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8">
			<Text>Augustus died in 14 CE, possibly succumbing to his constant ill-health, or possibly murdered by Livia, his wife. The latter is a popular theory, but most historians believe her to be innocent. His last words were “Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit.”</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_AUGUSTUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9">
			<Text>Plato writes that democracies always degenerate into tyranny. The legacy of Augustus and Julius Caesar might confirm this. While Augustus was not the bold adventurer his great-uncle was, he manipulated the reins of power in Rome. He was intelligent, patient, and built the foundations of a civilization that became an inspiration to nearly all others in Europe. While Julius Caesar – hero of the army and spurner of the senate – might inspire coup leaders worldwide, Augustus inspired emperors… and game designers. In his wake, Rome entered centuries of peace, the Pax Romana.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The conception of the United States of America has taken many contradictory forms over the years, including a haven for religious dissidents, a plantation-based economy focused on enslavement, an experiment in Enlightenment ideals, an expansionist republic intent on dominating the continent, and even the world’s center of capitalism.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Benjamin Franklin’s vision of America was a blend of secularized Protestantism, capitalism, and notions of liberty. According to the writings of sociologist Max Weber, Franklin was emblematic of the transformation from Calvinism to an austere productive ethos where labor was considered good and diligent people were seen as good people. Therefore labor was a path to salvation – for the more secular-minded American founding fathers, thrift and labor become ends in and of themselves. This perspective creates an exponential rationalization of labor that focuses on efficiency, which Weber famously called “the iron cage.” As Franklin wrote, “He that murders a crown (i.e. wastes a coin on something unproductive), destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.”</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>Franklin’s ideas about liberty were also practical. To him, it seemed irrational for Americans to ship their manufactured goods back to England to be re-sold by English middlemen when they could be directly sold to Spanish colonies.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>He was also science-minded. His kite experiment is famous and led to his invention of the lightning rod. Famously, he invented bifocal glasses, swim fins, a more efficient fireplace, a catheter, and the armonica (a musical instrument involving glasses of water). These innovations showcase Franklin's curiosity and interest in creating practical things (with the exception of the armonica).</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>Franklin may lean heavily upon the ideas of thrift and industry because he came from relatively modest means, unlike many other “founding fathers.” Born in Boston in 1706 and lacking formal education, Franklin made his fortune after moving to Philadelphia in 1723 to begin a printing business. Despite his lack of education, Franklin was an adept writer, publishing essays in his brother’s newspaper in Boston before continuing the tradition in Philadelphia, where he published the Pennsylvania Gazette. In Philadelphia, he also published the most famous work of his early life, Poor Richard’s Almanack, which carried his trademark clever prose alongside sound advice.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>Franklin's personal life was tireless as he also founded Philadelphia’s volunteer fire company, police patrols, philosophical society, and the University of Pennsylvania. He became postmaster for Philadelphia in 1737 and postmaster general for all colonies in 1753. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>The British eventually became suspicious of Franklin's rebellious nature, and for good reason. As early as 1734, Franklin formed the Albany Plan, a proposal for a unified government between the Thirteen Colonies, which was similar to the later Articles of Confederation. Franklin eventually represented Pennsylvania in London and rallied against infamous economic laws (such as the Stamp Act) that had given the colonies reason for revolution.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8">
			<Text>Franklin could be pedantic and needling, but he always impressed his listeners. Famously, he fought with John Adams over whether to keep a window open at night, a long and contentious battle that lasted hours. At other times, Franklin’s comedic skills were apparent; when the British debated sending convicts as settlers to America, Franklin laconically proposed that American convicts be sent to England in exchange.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9">
			<Text>Among Franklin’s greatest contributions was his role in helping draft the Declaration of Independence. During the Revolutionary War, he represented the United States in France, lobbying for France’s participation in the conflict, something that likely had more to do with Anglo-French rivalry than Franklin’s diplomacy.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_10">
			<Text>Ultimately, Franklin is noted as an architect of the governing philosophy of the United States, a task he performed with tireless devotion and no small amount of humor. Allegedly, he characterized the United States' new form of government as “a republic, if you can keep it.” It remains to be seen if that republic will keep.</Text>

			<Text>Russian history is one of rises and falls, and a high or low point always anticipates its opposite. When the Romanovs took power in the 17th century from the Rurikid dynasty, the dynasty that traced its lineage back to the semi-mythical Rurik the Viking, it was a move out of a period of chaos and into a European world.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Romanovs played two distinct parties against each other. The “Slavophiles” emphasized Russia’s distinction from the West, whereas the “Europhiles” believed Russia was a part of the West. The early Romanovs – especially Catherine and Peter – were decidedly the latter. They embraced European engineering and art, German nobility, and the French language. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>In previous centuries many European powers were absolute monarchies: bureaucratic states centered on a particular individual. In Russia, this was intensely personalized, and the whims of the tsar (or tsarina) dictated policy. This could reach bizarre heights – while Peter the Great is lauded for his progressiveness in European (especially British) circles, his reign was intensely driven by personality and a commitment to autocracy.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>In a way, Catherine's story starts with Peter the Great, who ruled from 1682-1725 and reshaped Russia. He expanded its borders and built a capital at St. Petersburg, formerly a Finnic-speaking frontier. Under Peter, Russia became an iron mining and timber powerhouse and gained a naval port on the Baltic. Peter also cultivated marriage alliances with other European powers and implemented Western dress and French language at court.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>Militarily, Peter’s reign was marked by victories against the Ottomans, and a massive war over control of the Baltic – Russia was concerned with Europe, pushing westward militarily and diplomatically. Culturally, Peter is depicted as an enlightened despot, a devotee of industry and science, but this ambition was tempered by his profligacy at home. He engaged in late-night drinking bouts, brutal parties centered around abusing less-liked courtiers.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">

Upon her conversion to Orthodoxy, Princess Sophie became Tsarina Catherine. The marriage was not happy. Peter III was stuck in permanent adolescence, playing with toy soldiers and drinking in court rather than governing – or procreating.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9">
			<Text>When Peter III ascended to the throne in 1762, he continued his legacy of bad choices. Moreover, he lacked a global strategy. The year before, Russia had been at war with Prussia, but Peter admired the Prussian leader Friedrich II and signed an extremely conciliatory treaty. Peter also alienated powerful allies. He had inherited a claim on a duchy in Denmark and decided to wage war against that country despite long-running Russian-Danish alliances.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_10">
			<Text>In short, Peter III looked like a disaster for Russia. Several people could have deposed him – rival nobles, the military, a foreign power – but Catherine was the one who successfully organized the coup. Peter was deposed in 1762, and Catherine took the crown herself.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_11">
			<Text>Catherine was a classic “enlightened despot,” an absolute ruler without the impulse for liberalism or the rights of the people, and a leader who wielded power via engagement with arts and philosophy. Her internal rule was a strange series of sexual politics. She would often appoint her lovers to high-status positions, holding to Russia’s personality-based political ladder. Potemkin was one of the most famous examples – an extremely competent advisor who governed Russia’s outlying provinces, worked to modernize the state, and conducted a great deal of other reforms (although his use of fake villages built to impress the visiting tsarina, known as “Potemkin Villages,” are now understood to be a myth). When Catherine and Potemkin's affair was over, Potemkin allegedly named his successor to Catherine’s bedchambers.</Text>

Internally, she also oversaw growth in higher education for women and other educational reforms.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CATHERINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_13">
			<Text>Abroad, Catherine expanded the boundaries of Russia, chipping away at Poland and the Ottomans along the way. However, she saw Russia as a mediator more than as an expansive empire. Catherine’s shrewd instincts were displayed during the American Revolution – she did not see the war as a fundamental shift in world politics, and therefore a threat, but as a failure of King George III, and thus an opportunity. She lobbied to preserve trade and end blockades, exploiting the conflict for Russia’s profit.</Text>

			<Text>The term “Fall of Rome” is a bit disingenuous – in the East, the Byzantines continued using the name Rome centuries after the fall of the western empire. However, the Byzantines were eventually challenged for that title by a smaller upstart. The Franks were a Germanic tribe that conquered much of the land that we know today as France, blending the already-blended Gallo-Roman culture with their own. Over time, these Frankish kings laid the groundwork for the Middle Ages and shaped modern-day France and Germany.</Text>

			<Text>In 768 CE, Charlemagne inherited a relatively stable Frankish kingdom and decided to expand it. He aggressively pushed against the pagan Europeans to his east, conquering large stretches of Bavaria and parts of northern Germany and Italy, including lands belonging to the Avars, horse nomads from Central Asia that had moved into Europe. In Spain, Charlemagne also clashed with the rising Umayyad Caliphate. While these Muslims sought to consolidate control over Iberia and wrest it from the Gothic and Basque presence, Charlemagne wished to incorporate the region into his larger empire. </Text>

			<Text>Rome was nervous about Charlemagne's Frankish expansion and sought to make allies. Meanwhile, the new Pope Leo III had become politically isolated and faced familial reprisal in Rome.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CHARLEMAGNE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>This was no mere title. The Byzantines already saw themselves as heirs of Rome – suddenly the Franks were a new western empire (at least in claim), and they were a challenge for the holy mantle of a pre-emptive Christian kingdom (this tension would later lead to the schism between Eastern and Western Christianity.) The conflict between the Byzantines and the Franks may have been rooted in sexism – at the time the Byzantines were ruled by a woman, Irene of Athens, so Pope Leo’s claim that he saw no Roman emperor before anointing Charlemagne could be seen as an attack on Irene’s right to rule. Leo’s actions were the first steps towards establishing the pope as the one who decided the pre-eminent ruler in Europe, a status that would dominate the Holy Roman Empire until Napoleon seized the crown a millennium later.</Text>

			<Text>In spirit, Charlemagne was known to be both jolly and fierce. Reconstructing his personality is difficult because, in the tradition of medieval Germanic rulers attempting to build their eternal legacy, he often spread stories of his own greatness, crafting narratives that were not always firmly grounded in fact. For instance, he described his campaigns against the Muslims in Spain as a crusade to retake the holy land – it certainly was not, as Spain is quite far from Jerusalem, but the claim sold the idea and would feed into the later Crusades. When Charlemagne cited his status as a Catholic, he claimed to be the only true Christian king (a snub at the other branches of Christianity active in the world at the time), and he “naturally” felt his reign included Jerusalem, though the Abbasid rulers of that city at the time would not have recognized this.</Text>

			<Text>Kongzi, Master Kong, is better known by his Hellenized name of “Confucius.” He was a government official and philosopher from an early period in Chinese history, the 500s BCE, slightly before the Han Dynasty and the very dawn of China. His writings emphasized rational, benevolent behavior, devotion to one’s duty, and respect for tradition. Importantly, Confucius trusted the system – if individuals strove to educate themselves and adopted a sense of good faith and loyalty to others (especially their families), they would serve as a check on greedy and power-hungry leaders.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CONFUCIUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Confucius had plenty of examples of terrible leaders. As the Shang Dynasty fell apart, a new, loosely-assembled dynasty arose: the Zhou (1046-256 BCE). Under this dynasty, individual states led by particular generals held sway over a smaller, more centralized state ruled by the emperor. Imagine a popular person at school surrounded by a crowd of bullies constantly fighting for the claim to be their absolute best friend and protector. Oddly enough, fractured and contentious political situations are often fertile ground for writers and philosophers – just ask Machiavelli. Confucius lived on the eastern edge of China at some point during this war-torn period. As his political world broke down around him, Confucius spent his life advocating for sensible order and good governance. Confucian influence calls on would-be charismatic or forceful rulers to curb their power and work for the common good.</Text>

			<Text>Born to a slightly upper (but not aristocratic) caste in the duchy of Lu, Confucius slowly rose through the ranks of local administration. He saw the problems inherent in the era and sought to appeal to central authority over the chaos. For instance, when he attained mayorship of a small town, he sought to dismantle its walls. Walls intended to defend against attacks from rival families; with the walls removed, Confucius thought the local duke would have to take a more direct role in defending the town.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CONFUCIUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>But rulers often disappoint. Confucius was regularly stymied by those he sought to advise – those he counseled in moderation were led astray by his opponent's flattery and lavish gifts, while others fell victim to personal vices. Eventually, Confucius’ enemies engineered to have him exiled for a time. Upon his return to Lu, he settled down and spent most of his time writing.</Text>

			<Text>His works include the Five Classics of Confucian philosophy. These texts contain poems, political speeches, historical records, and catalogs of rituals, rites, and magic. The latter discusses the divination system I Ching, still popular today. Confucius’ teachings have been distilled into collections by his disciples, including the Analects, his most famous work. The other Four Books of Confucianism include Great Learning, Doctrine of the Mean (a morality lesson for all, not just rulers), and a series of conversations with the scholar Mencius.</Text>

			<Text>“Know your place, and do it well” might be one way to summarize Confucian philosophy, as well as “respect tradition,” and “act always with kindness.” Confucianism exists somewhere in between philosophy, religion, and moralism. It is a principle that is humanist at its core, emphasizing heaven's presence (tian) in interpersonal interaction, good government, and good ethics. Being loyal to one’s family and friends, being mindful of one’s duties, and being harmonious is the natural tendency of humankind.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CONFUCIUS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>In its early days, Confucianism clashed with Legalism. The latter saw top-down codes of conduct necessary to constrain human nature, which inclined towards sin. Later, Confucian codes began to synergize with Legalist codes. Confucian societies include China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, as well as states that are heavily influenced by Chinese thought (e.g. Singapore). Its principles now include notions of benevolence, justice, observance of proper custom and decorum, knowledge, and integrity, as well as loyalty, filial piety (i.e. loyalty to one’s family and betters), and righteousness. While Confucianism does emphasize subjection to rulers, rulers must show themselves to be subject to tian – rulers who fail to live up to heaven’s standards face the disloyalty of their populace.</Text>

			<Text>Friedrich the Great was the longest-ruling king of Prussia, from 1740-1786. He lived in a time of art and literature as well as Prussian military dominance. Friedrich was caught between worlds. His love of the arts clashed with the militarism of the time. His homosexuality clashed with imperial demands to marry and produce an heir. His Francophilia clashed with the militant anti-French nationalism at large in Prussia. In short, he was trapped, yet he managed to stay alive and nurture both sides of Prussia: the artistic and the militant.</Text>

His wife, Sophia Dorothea, was quite the opposite and found the court stifling. She was far more Francophile than Friedrich William. Prussia's court language was French and both monarchs were fluent, but Friedrich William was notoriously ungrammatical in the language. Other French court customs were shunned as Prussian frugality won over. </Text>

			<Text>Friedrich II was the third son; his two elder brothers died young, so much of his parents’ hope rested on the young Friedrich. Sophia Dorothea sought to instill in her son the love of high culture and court life that her husband disdained. He also learned French; in fact, he was not terribly fluent in German despite being German. But there was conflict between father and son. As much as Friedrich loved learning Latin and high culture, his father pressured him to adopt a harsh austerity. Tensions grew, and Friedrich eventually maintained a hidden library in a palace across town. </Text>

			<Text>Friedrich William was concerned about his son’s sexuality – while rumors abounded about the teenager’s love affairs, their “effeminacy” bothered the king the most, and he feared that the new state of Prussia might crumble without a sober and militaristic king. Ironically, his diplomatic ineptitude was causing headaches in the empire: his loyalty to a German monarchy led him to curry favor with Austrian monarchs, who despised the austere Prussian.</Text>

			<Text>For all of Friedrich’s attention to art and culture, he remained an accomplished strategist. Prussia, which had been a shaky, unstable, militaristic power, was suddenly rising to become a major force, especially after seizing the wealthiest parts of Austria.

			<Text>In short, Friedrich was a capable military leader who – despite his father – pushed Prussia ever outward.

He died in 1786 in his palace.</Text>

			<Text>Friedrich was a lifelong patron of the arts, especially French and Italian arts, and cultivated friendships with Voltaire and other luminaries. As French artists and thinkers became increasingly uncertain in France, they found a home in the Prussian court alongside other intellectuals of the day, like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Classical-era composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach. Friedrich also sponsored an architectural revival, particularly in the late Baroque style, or Rococo, an elaboration upon Enlightenment forms that seek to soften (or overwhelm) the strict geometric forms of French architecture.</Text>

			<Text>Friedrich’s legacy is twofold: the rise of Prussian militarism on one hand, and the flourishing of late Baroque arts on the other. People like Thomas Mann saw Friedrich as a ruthless expansionist seeking to chip away at Austria (which is true). Others accused Friedrich of contributing to the sparks that ignited the French Revolution by establishing a court of French philosophers and thinkers who could freely speak of sedition (also true). Ultimately, one can see Friedrich as a model for truly modern despotism, ruling by sword and pen and creating a firm break from a feudal past.</Text>

			<Text>Slavery's legacy in the American South is long and complicated. As early as the 1500s, the enslavement of native people and the transport of enslaved Africans became a cornerstone of European colonies in the Caribbean and the southern region of the Thirteen Colonies. Cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, and sugar were as lucrative as the gold and silver mines in Spanish territories and existed for the same profit-oriented reasons. Colonial plantations were not farms but factories – large estates owned by one family or person that relied on a large body of replaceable labor provided with the bare minimum to keep this labor going.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_HARRIET_TUBMAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Detailing the horrors of this system is beyond the scope of this article. In short, slavery sought to strip the humanity from individuals and families and reduce people to their labor. Marriage, education, free time – those things that we take to be parts of a fulfilling life were denied to people who were, contrary to earlier systems of slavery, denied their basic humanity. American slavery was entwined with racism as well, with an ideology that Africans were fundamentally not human in the same way others were, citing both pseudo-biology and Biblical passages to justify what was at its core an economic system of domination. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_HARRIET_TUBMAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>But in Harriet Tubman’s time, things were changing. Europeans (Denmark, at first) had begun to ban the trade of enslaved people in 1803, while the United States banned the importation of new enslaved Africans into the country soon after – though this did not prohibit the continued enslavement of African Americans already present. Around this time, Haiti erupted in revolution, marking the first successful slave revolt in the world and charting a new path forward. England banned slavery in most of its colonies in 1833, despite its extensive holdings in the Caribbean and Africa. The USA remained a holdout for an institution that had long grown unpopular worldwide, and this position was to tear the country apart. It is worth noting that the time between worldwide disgust at the institution and the end of slavery in the USA was an entire generation – someone could be born when slavery was being widely banned in Europe and die a grandparent before its abolition in the USA.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_HARRIET_TUBMAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>Trade in enslaved people grew more tenuous in the United States after these bans – by that time, most African Americans were two or three generations removed from Africa. But two major factors came into play during Tubman’s time – the development of the cotton gin, which allowed plantations to produce far more cotton with unskilled labor in far less time, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which stipulated a requirement to “return” escapees to their “owners.”</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_HARRIET_TUBMAN_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>All these factors combined created an environment in which trade in enslaved people was limited to the USA, the productive potential of enslaved labor vastly increased, and whites could simply “claim” that any Black person they captured was an escapee. Unfortunately, these claims happened all too often –residents of New York, for instance, were subject to seeing groups of Black people in chains being “repatriated” back to the South even though some of them had never seen the South. The anger of abolitionists began to increase, and the fires of the Civil War had begun. </Text>

			<Text>The Underground Railroad (UGRR) was closely associated with Harriet Tubman and this time period. It was a series of safehouses and guides – “stations” and “conductors" – used to move escapees away from the South and towards freedom in Canada. These were networks of free Black people and white abolitionists (often Quakers) operating largely independently of each other, for everyone’s safety. While the South saw this as an invasion of their property rights, the North was (largely) sympathetic. War seemed inescapable.</Text>

Elsewhere, China’s first dynasties had not yet been formed. Hatshepsut is as close to the Pyramids as we are to the Viking Age.

This was a time of colossal statues (not pyramid-building, as that age had passed), of tombs in hidden canyons, of kings and other nobles hunting captive animals taken from the African wilderness. Scribes wrote on astrology and magic, medicine and science; these scholars could be male or female. Farmers depended upon the Nile, and laborers (not slaves) worked in the cities. We have an impression of Egyptian monuments and cities composed entirely of sand-colored stone, but the outsides of temples and palaces were painted bright white while their insides were brilliant yellow and green.</Text>

When Thutmose II died, Hatshepsut remained on the throne as a regent for her infant stepson Thutmose III (the son of Thutmose and a minor wife as Hatshepsut only had a daughter). However, she swept past the bounds of a normal regent and declared herself pharaoh. Her reasons for this power grab are unknown but might be related to her ambition or an unknown political crisis.</Text>

Afterward, Hatshepsut claimed the title of co-ruler, becoming the younger king in a partnership with her stepson – though she wielded most of the practical power. Her rule as a woman was not unusual. Kings’ mothers often ruled when their children were too young – historian Ann Macy Roth suggests that women ruled Egypt for about half of the seventy years preceding Hatshepsut.

At the time, Egypt faced the ruins of the Hyksos invasion, a movement of people from the Near East into Egypt. Hatshepsut sought to rebuild the temples the invaders had destroyed. In so doing, she commissioned an enormous amount of sculpture; sadly, much of it was later destroyed by those seeking to erase her legacy. The temple at Deir el-Bahri seems to be her crowning achievement, a vast colonnade with a sweeping entrance staircase. After the preceding period of ruin, these construction projects propped up Hatshepsut’s legitimacy. With Egypt still reeling from war and her non-standard lineage, the queen needed to double down on any claim to godly heritage. Her declarations of godhood were as politically calculated as they were religious.</Text>

Thus archaeologists found many of her statues in a great pile of smashed art, a waste pit of Thutmose III's design. These statues are interesting for several reasons. Kings were the embodiment of Horus, a male god, so when Hatshepsut claimed the mantle of king, she needed to become male, at least symbolically, and many of her statues were changed from female to male; at the same time, many of Hatshepsut's male relatives and contacts began to use female pronouns to better align with her.</Text>

This mystical reputation is compounded in Japanese records, which identify Himiko with a number of divine beings: as the high shaman of the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu, or a shamanic wife of a divine snake. In this latter story, Himiko (identified by the name Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto) is happily married to a clearly divine being who only visits at night. She begs him to stay until morning so that she can see him in the sunlight, but he demurs. Eventually, she convinces him, and he tells her that she will see him in her toilet-case, but she must promise not to be shocked at his appearance. The next morning, when she opens the case, there is a beautiful white snake coiled inside. Himiko gasps in alarm, and the god-snake changes back to his human form.

She is vivacious and tricksy, taking part in contests, disguising herself as a man, hiding from the other gods, and the like. In one of her most famous myths, the god Susanoo, her younger brother who was famously rude and troublesome, comes to Amaterasu to say his farewell after their father exiles him. Amaterasu decides to take pity on the boy. They have a chewing contest to see who can spit out the most gods, and although Amaterasu wins, Susanoo declares that he has spat out the correct gods and falls into a rage. In one version, he is so angry that he sneaks into Amaterasu’s palace and places excrement on her throne. She sits in it. This is so upsetting that she runs into a cave and hides herself (a problem because, remember, she is the sun). The other gods hatch a plan to draw her out, and they gather outside of her cave and make a great spectacle. This makes her curious, and she peeks out to see who is there – what she sees is her own reflection. The gods have hung a mirror just outside the entrance, and Amaterasu is transfixed. Order is restored (and, incidentally, the mirror becomes a vital symbol of Shinto). </Text>

From nearly the beginning of the caliphates’ arrival in the eighth century CE, Christian rulers pushed back against this rule. The final movement – the conquest of the Emirate of Granada – happened in 1492, under Isabella.</Text>

This purpose did not stop after the fall of Granada. Shortly thereafter, Christopher Columbus set sail across the Atlantic Ocean with the goal of securing a lucrative trade route to the Indies to fund a new Crusade. The ensuing conquest of the New World occurred alongside more forays into former Arab territory.</Text>

			<Text>Isabella’s Spain was also intent on colonizing minds. The populace of formerly Muslim spaces was religiously diverse, and non-Muslims were permitted to practice their religion provided they paid a special tax (the jizya). Under Christian rule, Christianity was forcibly imposed, and those who were not willing to convert were driven out – even the Moors who did convert were subsequently expelled a century later. Social anxieties assumed that forced converts were not the most pious Christians, so the Reconquista gave way to the Spanish Inquisition.</Text>

The resulting war was inconclusive, but young Alfonso was unable to claim the throne; he died of plague. Isabella and the rebels made a deal wherein Isabella would become the heir instead. This arrangement also stipulated that she would not be forced into marriage, so when she did marry the king of Aragon, Ferdinand, it was likely out of love. </Text>

She sought to improve criminal codes that had grown lax under Henry and conquer the hearts and minds of her Spanish subjects, including those in newly conquered territories. This goal extended to indigenous Americans. While Columbus was brazen in his subjugation of indigenous people, Isabella was not.

She remains a crucial figure in Spanish history, having begun the wave of overseas expansion that would lead to the Spanish Empire and presiding over the Inquisition and the end of the Reconquista. Ultimately, Isabella laid the foundations of the Catholic empire that Spain would become throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, setting it on a collision course with rising Protestant powers.</Text>

			<Text>But Rizal’s primary love was his homeland. His writing became more strident as the Spanish cracked down on nationalism. In his “El Filibusterismo” (“Reign of Greed" in English), his hero becomes increasingly frustrated with the cynical and greedy outlook of local administrators and seeks to abandon liberal reforms for violent overthrow. This deeply concerned the Spanish, who were already worried about Rizal’s work radicalizing Filipino expatriates and exiles in Madrid. But Rizal’s mission, contrary to that of his hero, seems reasonable today – the transformation of the Philippines into a core province of Spain, the promotion of Filipinos to higher positions within the priesthood, and the granting of freedoms of speech and assembly.

The monarchy retrenched and the Third Estate (the peasants) rose up to take over particular sites, most notably the infamous prison, the Bastille. To keep order, the Assembly created the National Guard of France with the noble Lafayette in command. This offered a shaky truce, but Lafayette was capable. For example, when the National Guard marched on the palace to deliver the Declaration to the king, the people broke into the Palace of Versailles, and Lafayette ushered the royal family out to a balcony overlooking the crowd. When people cried “Shoot her,” referring to Marie Antoinette, Lafayette kissed her hand, diverting a massacre (which was still to come) into a public show of royalist piety.</Text>

Machiavelli focused on reconstructing the grounds for power as a means of keeping it. For instance, while it might be ideal for a ruler to maintain the love of his subjects, the best alternative is to be feared. A prince should strive to be honest; if this is impossible, then he should lie and keep the appearance of honesty. From a Machiavellian perspective, certain measures – such as wiping out powerful rival families or instilling fear in the population – are necessities in some situations. In short, “The Prince” is a guidebook to being a ruthless, manipulative, despicable – but successful – ruler. </Text>

			<Text>Machiavelli reshaped how we think about power and control, moving away from high-minded ideals towards practical considerations. He could be considered in contrast with a person like Confucius, someone who had been in a very similar position as a court advisor (though to a far larger empire in a far earlier time). Confucius thought there should be a strict code of conduct focused on respect for tradition and goodwill towards others, and that following this code would mean that rulers would prosper. Machiavelli is the opposite – a modernist and pragmatist. His brutal (or brutally honest) stance earned him the enmity of other famous historical figures. Prussia’s Friedrich II penned the “Anti-Machiavelli,” which sought to extol the virtues of the enlightened despot over the manipulative prince, but was undercut by Prussia’s own power-hungry status.</Text>

			<Text>Perhaps Machiavelli's reputation is undeserved. He addressed his book to the Medici family – his torturers and banishers. Later readers may note his more sympathetic attitude towards republics in “Discourses on Livy.” One can picture an elder Machiavelli, exiled in his country home, bearing the scars of torture, writing a cynical and bitter discourse on how to exercise power without conscience before adding his torturers’ name in the dedication, saying to the Medicis, “Here, here is who you really are."</Text>

			<Text>Regardless, Machiavelli is considered one of the first modernist political philosophers who tried to think strategically and systematically about how populations function. His works could be considered satire; it is a dark statement that such a dystopic view of the world has become the foundation of much of our modern politics.</Text>

			<Text>The Kingdom of Cuzco was ruled by the Sapa Inca, the “only Inca,” a lineage supposedly descended from the sun itself and which became hereditary over time. But before this, the Sapa Inca was determined through a series of challenges and divination, or, for Pachacuti, smarts and good fortune.</Text>

			<Text>Pachacuti, whose given name was Cusi Yupanqui, was one of several sons of the preceding Inca, Viracocha Inca. Viracocha was a proud and warlike emperor who claimed he would conquer half of the world. Naturally, other people objected to this, and some of them – the Chanka, another Quechua-speaking group – decided to eclipse the would-be sun before his conquest began. Abandoning his claim, Viracocha fled the capital with his favored son, Urco Inca, who had been acknowledged as the next Inca. This left Cusi Yupanqui to fend off invaders. According to legend, Cusi Yupanqui’s defense was so brilliant that the stones rose up to fight for him – it sounds like a poetic allegory, but the Inca religion revolved around the tirakuna, earth beings who embody the mountains and rocks. The invaders fell, and Cusi Yupanqui offered the captives to his father so his father could wipe his feet. His father refused; Viracocha wanted his older son, Urco, to be the next Inca and to make the offering. The ensuing argument went poorly, and Viracocha became so offended that he plotted to assassinate Cusi Yupanqui. This plan failed and Viracocha was run out of the capital, leaving Cusi Yupanqui to become Pachacuti.</Text>

			<Text>Pachacuti means “reformer of the world,” but could also translate to “cataclysm” or “earth-shaker.” His expansion involved fortifying Cuzco into a distinct city with large stone structures, districts for each social class, elaborate road systems, and a well-defined priesthood (vital to the selection of the next Inca). Under Pachacuti, Cuzco became a proper empire. This system of rule centered on the divinity of the ruler – Inca rulers often married within their own families to preserve their divine ancestry.</Text>

			<Text>Outside of Cuzco, the empire incorporated disparate groups, consuming artistic styles and cultural elements with imperial style. Notable construction under Pachacuti included Machu Pikchu (which was possibly Pachacuti’s private estate) and the Temple of the Sun in Cuzco. Settlers were aggressively dispatched to new communities, and each settlement followed a distinct caste-like system where particular groups lived in certain areas. Pachacuti also composed a series of religious hymns.</Text>

He became a hero and inspiration to Quechua leaders, including the ill-fated rulers who encountered the Spanish – and the rebels who fought them. Without Pachacuti, the Andes might look more diverse, but they would also lack a sense of Andean civilization’s greatness.</Text>

			<Text>Look at a map of Southeast Asia and southern East Asia and take note of a few key details. Travel by water is much easier than travel by land, especially where monsoons and rainforests make moving too far into the landscape impossible. Rivers – the Irrawaddy, the Salween, the Chao Phraya, and the Mekong – become lifelines for rice-planting civilizations; other realms are built upon trade routes. Mountains are walls – in Laos and along the western borders of Vietnam, no rivers cross them, and they are thickly forested. This is why Vietnam, originating in the Red River delta and possessing a relatively open (geographically) border with China, struggled mostly with its northern neighbor, and also incorporated so much of Chinese culture; yet as one goes further south and west, Indian influence grows.</Text>

			<Text>Trung Trac’s story begins more than two centuries before her birth (around the time of the construction of the terracotta warriors) when a military commander from the collapsing Qin Empire fled south and seized lands from Hong Kong to Hanoi. He called this new kingdom Nanyue, the Southern Yue kingdom, pronounced Nam Viet in Vietnamese. He also declared it to be independent…of sorts. The newly ascendant Han Dynasty tolerated Nanyue's existence as long as it remained a Chinese vassal. The Yue people likely included a wide variety of unrelated groups: Cantonese speakers, Vietnamese people (kinh), Tai speakers, and Trung Trac’s people – the Lac Viet.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_TRUNG_TRAC_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>Over time, the Han reconsolidated and sought expansion. In 111 BCE, they conquered Nanyue directly. During this “First Chinese Domination of Vietnam,” the Han embarked on an aggressive campaign to turn Yue “tribes” into good Chinese subjects. This involved aggressive suppression of Vietnamese customs and the imposition of Confucianism, the imperial political system, and Chinese writing. These measures were not popular.</Text>

			<Text>The term “Persia” originates from the Greek name for the empire of Iran, the land of the Farsi people, who are referred to as “Aryan” in other texts (bearing in mind the term’s association with North India and not with the strange alterations it carried in the 19th and 20th centuries). In the Achaemenid period, Persia was the largest empire at that point in history (Alexander the Great took that title a few years later). The empire extended from Egypt and parts of Greece in the west to the Indus River Valley in the east, encompassing and surpassing what we now know as the Middle and Near East today. Despite its size, or perhaps because of it, Persia had sophisticated transportation networks and bureaucratic and communication systems; was multi-cultural and multi-religious; and established a clear lingua franca throughout its domain. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_XERXES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Early on, the Persians took slow control over Mesopotamia as Babylon and Assyria declined. Under Cyrus the Great, it expanded into Asia Minor and transformed into an empire. Cyrus' line was overthrown by Darius – also "the Great" – who led the Persians to another wave of conquests, this time in Egypt and the Indus Valley. But this triumph was tenuous. With revolt brewing in Egypt, Darius suddenly died and was succeeded by Xerxes – the last and arguably greatest of the Persian emperors.</Text>

			<Text>Xerxes became famous for his campaign against Greece, including the battles of Thermopylae and Salamis. He was a subject of Herodotus’s histories, an inspiration for Alexander the Great, and an icon for cruel tyrants – largely based on Greek perspective. However, while Xerxes was proud and occasionally cruel, he was no cartoon villain.</Text>

			<Text>Xerxes descended from two great emperors – his father was Darius, and his grandfather (on his mother’s side) was Cyrus. He was raised by court eunuchs, as was the custom, and taught horsemanship (the Persians were only a few generations out from being Central Asian horse nomads). His life in the palace of Babylon was one of luxury.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_XERXES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>Xerxes' early brush with destiny came when Darius, preparing to leave for Egypt to quash its rebellion, fell ill and unexpectedly died. In the wake of this death, the question of succession loomed. Should the crown go to Darius’ eldest? Or to Xerxes, the grandson of Cyrus? A debate was arranged to solve this question, and Xerxes won, taking the throne in 486 BCE, at the age of 35. He also inherited his father’s wars and immediately took to quelling Egypt, followed by Babylon after that city rebelled. He enacted a brutal vengeance upon Babylon, melting the statues of its gods in punishment. Indeed, Xerxes was staunchly religious (likely adhering to a precursor of Zoroastrianism).</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_XERXES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>Still, Xerxes is most famous for his invasion of Greece. Darius had attempted such a campaign, which seemed logical since Persia already occupied all of Asia Minor. However, Darius was thwarted at Marathon. Following in his father’s footsteps, Xerxes pulled no punches. He amassed a gargantuan army, built a bridge over the Hellespont (the straits at modern Istanbul), and marched his troops over it. At the Battle of Thermopylae, Xerxes' massive Persian army was stalled by only around 7,000 Spartans – a battle that has become the most renowned example of Spartan bravery in history. However, the keyword here is “stalled,” not “stopped.” Xerxes eventually continued down the Greek coast, and Athens was destroyed. Many Athenians fled to the island of Salamis and bunkered down as the Persians prepared a naval assault. Unfortunately, that battle did not go in favor of the Persians. After the Athenians won, the Persians – mindful of their fragile bridge over the Hellespont – decided that they’d had enough.</Text>

			<Text>Alexander the Great would enact Greece's revenge more than a century later, but this failure brought an end to Xerxes’s plans of domination. Upon returning home to Persia, he turned his gaze inward, funding a dramatic boom in construction, arts, and infrastructure. Persian roads and postal relay systems were some of the most advanced the world had ever seen, and the great capital of Persepolis continued to rise in splendor. Though these ambitious projects did irreparable damage to the royal treasury, the remains of Xerxes’ palaces and monuments are still visible today. He was assassinated in 465.</Text>

			<Text>In Greek texts, Xerxes often plays a foil to democratic Athens. Indeed, this Greek portrait colors our modern view of Asia and Asian antiquity. When the Greeks categorized the Persians as despotic, aggressive, fundamentally undemocratic, and weak from living in a soft climate of rich land, that says more about Greek resentment than it does about real history. This trope persists because Athens reports most of our Greek history, and they accomplished this by juxtaposing themselves with others: Athenian democracy versus Spartan militarism and Athenian freedom versus Persian despotism. They didn't necessarily chronicle things as they were; they made a political point.</Text>
