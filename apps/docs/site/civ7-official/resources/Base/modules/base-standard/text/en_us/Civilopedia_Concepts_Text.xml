			<Text>Wonders are monumental structures that stand out thanks to their unique presence and significant bonuses. Each Wonder is modeled after an iconic real-world landmark that has left a lasting impact on history. Wonders require significant time to complete, but once constructed, they provide Civilizations with immense benefits and resource buffs. Wonders can only be constructed during certain ages, but they remain ageless, meaning their bonuses carry over from one age to the next.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_WONDERS_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Each Wonder can only exist once in each game. If players begin construction on a Wonder but fail to complete it before another player, they are refunded 50% of their invested production.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_WONDERS_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">
			<Text>Every player has access to all the Wonders, and each one can be unlocked from either the Tech or Civic tree. However, each Civ also has an associated World Wonder, which means they receive a 30% bonus towards that specific Wonder's construction. Associated Wonders are also easier to unlock since their Civ has one additional place within the Tech or Civic trees to unlock them (Civ's can unlock their associated World Wonder from either location.)</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_WONDERS_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_4">
			<Text>Tip: Wonders provide an adjacency bonus to all buildings, so surrounding a Wonder with other buildings is a powerful strategy.</Text>

			<Text>Influence is a new Yield introduced in Civilization VII. It is the main currency for diplomatic gameplay. Players accrue Influence from various sources and spend it to undertake Diplomatic Actions with other players and Independent Powers.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_DIPLOMACY_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Diplomatic Actions include Endeavors, Sanctions, Independent Power interactions, and more. Endeavors are actions that benefit one or both parties which raises the relationship scores. Sanctions are actions that hurt the targeting party which lowers the relationship scores. Palaces, Buildings, and Wonders all award Influence, but it remains less abundant than other Resources. Once Influence is spent, it is not returned. However, the player does regain the Influence used if the opponent rejects an action.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_DIPLOMACY_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_STATEHOOD_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>Civilizations, commonly referred to as "Civs," are the core entities players control and develop throughout the game. Each Civ represents a unique cultural, political, and historical identity, embodying distinct strengths, abilities, and strategies. The goal is to lead a Civ to prosperity and dominance through various means, such as military conquest, cultural influence, scientific advancement, or economic domination.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_STATEHOOD_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Each Civ comes with unique attributes, such as special units, buildings, traditions, and abilities that reflect their historical and cultural heritage. These unique attributes provide strategic advantages and encourage diverse playstyles. Choosing a Civ that aligns with your preferred strategy can significantly impact your success.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_STATEHOOD_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">
			<Text>A unique set of Civs is available each Age, meaning no Civ lasts forever. As new Ages dawn, new Civs emerge, replacing those from previous eras. However, the Traditions researched by earlier Civs persist into the next Age. This layering of history ensures continuity and evolution, reflecting the dynamic nature of a civilization.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_STATEHOOD_2_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>Independent Powers have replaced the concept of Barbarians from previous Civ titles. All Independent Powers start the game at the Minor level. Through interaction, Independents can be promoted and advance to the Major level, which affords them the additional gameplay mechanics of city-states from previous titles.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_STATEHOOD_2_CHAPTER_VILLAGES_PARA_1">
			<Text>If a Minor Independent has a Friendly Affinity, it is set to be Friends with the nearest Major Power at the start of the game. If a Minor Independent has a Hostile Affinity, it is set to be Hostile with all Major Powers. If a Minor Independent has neither affinity, it starts in a Neutral state. Regardless of these starting positions, Minor Independents’ relationships will grow and evolve as the game progresses.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_STATEHOOD_2_CHAPTER_VILLAGES_PARA_REMOVED">
			<Text>If players attack a Minor Independent, they become Hostile. Likewise, an Independent’s friendliness reduces if players found Settlements near their Village. If the Settlement is within 3 tiles, the Independent immediately becomes Hostile; if the Settlement is 4 to 6 tiles away, the Relationship degrades one level (i.e., Friendly to Neutral; Neutral to Hostile). Players can Befriend an Independent through diplomatic actions once their Village has been discovered; this increases a progress bar, which raises the Independent’s friendliness level.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_STATEHOOD_2_CHAPTER_VILLAGES_PARA_2">
			<Text>Raiding is the main interaction between players and Independent Powers. An Independent Power will occasionally raid a nearby player, sending units to attack them. The player can also use diplomatic actions to incite the Independent Power to raid other nearby civilizations if the Independent is Hostile towards the Civ.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_CODEX_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">
			<Text>Most Codices are awarded by mastering Tech, but some come from the Civic Tree, narrative events, as a City-State Suzerain bonus, or for completing the Nalanda Wonder. Some Civs can also earn a Codex through Great People.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_CODEX_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_4">

			<Text>Major Independents are not present at the beginning of the game. Instead, they emerge when a Minor Independent is promoted by a Major Power (who becomes their Suzerain) via the Befriend Independent diplomatic action. When promoted, Independents gain an Urban hex, City Hall, and additional defenses (such as Walls) to reflect their new status as a Major Independent. Players who become a Suzerain will get to select a Suzerain bonus, and the Major Independents they promote will remain under them until the end of the Age. Major Independents will also align with the war/peace status of their Suzerain when interacting with other Major players.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_WARWEARINESS_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>War Weariness represents the willingness of the Civ’s population to continue a war effort. Wars that lack Support and have not achieved victory can lead to complete societal stagnation.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_WARWEARINESS_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>War Weariness is represented by the difference in Support between players during a War Support Action. The player with less Support incurs a penalty that is calculated based on the size of that difference.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_WARWEARINESS_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">
			<Text>Every point of War Weariness will reduce City Yields as follows: reduce Happiness by 3 in Settlements you founded, reduce Happiness by 5 in Settlements founded by someone else (unless it is a power you are currently At War with), reduce Happiness by 7 in Settlements founded by a power you are currently At War with, and reduce all Combat Strength by 1 (up to a total of 20).</Text>

			<Text>Gold is an empire-wide resource, similar to Science and Culture. Unlike those resources, however, unspent Gold accumulates in the player's treasury – after automatic expenses are deducted from income. The amount of Gold in the treasury is always visible in the upper left corner of the UI, alongside your Gold Income, which reflects the difference between your empire's expenses and earnings. Unlike other resources, it is possible to have a negative Gold income, which could severely hamper a Civ’s development.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_GOLD_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Gold has many uses, such as purchasing Units and Buildings, and covering the maintenance fees for those assets.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_GOLD_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">
			<Text>Tip: Towns are key players in a Civ’s economy. Towns convert their Production directly into Gold, making the expansion of your empire essential for maintaining a vibrant economy. However, this expansion introduces potential conflicts and risks, necessitating a careful strategic approach.</Text>

			<Text>To capture a settlement, attackers must gain control of a City/Town Center and any Urban tiles with its walled defenses. At times, there may be more than one capturing player. In this case, the player who controls the most urban tiles is the victor. In the case of ties, the Civ who captured the last urban tile is the winner.</Text>

			<Text>The City Center district starts with 50 Health and all other Urban districts start at zero. Districts with a health value are considered "defensible," and a district’s health must be reduced to zero before an attacker can advance onto that tile. Walls add health values to districts. Combat against a district only applies damage to the district and does not affect the buildings within. By default, districts reciprocate damage to an melee attacker. Damaged defensible districts will regenerate health automatically over time, provided the following conditions are met:[BLIST][LI]Must be controlled by the City owner.[LI]Cannot be occupied by an enemy unit or have adjacent enemy units.[LI]The City where the urban district is located has not had any district attacked for a number of turns.[/LIST]</Text>

			<Text>Wall defenses increase a district's health by 100. However, walls from a previous age only provide half the defense bonus and half the district health while walls older than one age provide no benefit. Walls from previous ages can be upgraded by overbuilding them with the current age walls. Wall defenses are not repaired through the City production queue; they automatically repair over time as long as they are not under attack and have no adjacent enemy units.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_CITYCAPTURE_1_CHAPTER_WALL_PARA_2">
			<Text>Wall defenses cannot be purchased with Gold, except in the City Center. Instead, walls in urban districts can be constructed one tile at a time from the City build queue, using Production. Walls cannot be constructed on Navigable River hexes and must be built adjacent to other wall defenses from the same settlement, starting with the City Center. Walls cannot be built adjacent to walls owned by a different settlement, except in the city center, which is always allowed.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_CITYCAPTURE_1_CHAPTER_WALL_PARA_3">
			<Text>When a unit attacks a defensible district, combat is resolved by taking the attacking unit's strength and comparing it to the defense strength of the district, which is calculated based on the strongest melee unit trained by the district owner minus a set value (10). Walls and all City or Town centers deal reciprocal damage to melee attackers.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_TILES_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>During a growth event, placing a point of population on a Rural tile results in an Improvement. Basic Improvements include Farms, Mines, Woodcutters, Clay Pits, and Fishing Boats. Conversely, placing a point of population on an Urban tile grants a Specialist. Specialists provide benefits such as increased Science, Culture, and building adjacency bonuses (+2 Science, +2 Culture, +0.5 Adjacency Bonus), but they also reduce the City's Food and Happiness (-2 Food, -2 Happiness).</Text>

			<Text>There are three types of Discoveries, each increasing in complexity, rewards, and rarity:[BLIST][LI][B]Basic Discoveries[/B] function similarly to classic Goody Huts. When a unit enters the tile, the discovery provides an immediate small reward and then disappears.[LI][B]Investigations[/B] require more investment, either by dedicating a unit to remain at the location for several turns, paying a resource yield such as gold, science, production, happiness, or culture—or a combination of both. Completing Investigations provides medium-sized rewards.[LI][B]Mythic Quests[/B] offer substantial challenges but also grant large rewards.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_DISASTER_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>Fertilization is not guaranteed with every disaster, and the probability of fertilization is determined separately for each tile. As a result, a single tile could potentially receive fertilization in one, two, or all three yield types from a single disaster, or it could not benefit at all. Only land tiles are eligible for fertilization. Over time, a tile hit by multiple disasters can become a high-yield tile.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_DISASTER_1_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_3">

			<Text>Basic Rules for the Armies Mechanic:[BLIST][LI]Army Formation: Each player can form one or more Armies. Armies can only be formed by a Commander unit. Once an Army is established, units can be added or removed either individually or in groups through the 'Pack' and 'Unpack' Commander actions.[LI]Army Capacity: Each Army has a capacity limit for both primary and civilian units. An Army’s initial capacity is 4 units, but this can be increased through various advancements like Promotions, Techs, Civics, etc.[LI]Movement: Commander units have a base Movement of 2. When packed with other combat units, the Commander gains a +1 Movement bonus.[LI]Unit Commands: Units and Armies possess unit-level commands that facilitate the addition and removal of units.[LI]Civilian Protection: Civilian layer units are typically unpacked as a stacked group with a primary layer unit for protection.[LI]Unpacking Requirements: Armies must unpack when they get attacked by enemies with sufficient strength.[LI]Commander Actions: Army Commander units can perform special actions when packed and unpacked. When Unpacked, Commander actions apply to all friendly units within their Command range (default range of 1).[LI]Overrun Attack: Armies can brush off smaller enemy forces with a special Overrun attack, allowing them to kill the opposing unit and enter their tile (expending a movement cost to enter that hex). Armies need combat odds of approximately 5:1 or greater to Overrun an opponent.[LI]Promotions: Promotions are assigned to the Commander unit at the 'army level.' Individual units no longer gain experience or promotions. Commander units with suitable experience levels will advance from one Age to the next, allowing investments in military action to continue through the Ages.[LI]Respawning: Defeated Commanders respawn after 20 turns on Standard Speed. They also respawn after Age transitions.[/LIST]</Text>

			<Text>Combat in Civilization VII retains many core principles from previous titles. Each military unit has a set of statistics that defines its combat capabilities, which can be enhanced through Commander promotions, terrain advantages, and other special bonuses. Key statistics include:[BLIST][LI]Hit Points (HP): Each unit has 100 hit points, also known as Health. When a unit takes damage, its HP decreases; stronger attacks cause more significant HP loss. A unit is destroyed if its HP drops to 0.[LI]Combat Strength (CS): This stat indicates a unit’s overall combat effectiveness. For melee units, this represents both its offensive and defensive power. For ranged units, this only accounts for its defensive power.[LI]Ranged Strength (RS): Specific to ranged units, this stat measures a unit’s attack power from a distance. However, ranged attacks are less effective against City Defenses and naval units.[LI]Range: This stat determines the distance a unit can attack and is relevant to ranged/siege units, some recon units, and Immortals. For example, a Range of 1 limits attacks to adjacent tiles, while a Range of 3 allows attacks up to three tiles away.[LI]Movement Points (MP): These points are used when units move or perform actions. Typically, 1 MP per tile is required to move over plains and water, but this can change with roads, hills, river crossings, and enemy zones of control. Units need sufficient MPs to move and attack, making high MP values beneficial for covering territory with fewer units.[LI]Sight: This stat indicates how many tiles a unit can reveal around its position, removing the "fog of war." Most units have a Sight range of 2. While not a direct combat stat, Sight is crucial for allowing ranged units to identify targets.[LI]Bombard Strength: Bombard attacks are more effective against fortified tiles compared to ranged attacks, making actual siege units the preferred choice for delivering superior firepower against such defenses. Both ranged and siege land units use their bombard strength when attacking naval units, resulting in ranged units inflicting less damage and siege units inflicting more damage on naval targets.[/LIST]</Text>
