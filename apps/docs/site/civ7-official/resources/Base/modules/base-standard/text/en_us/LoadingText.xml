		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_AMINA">
			<Text>Amina, sarauniya of the Hausa, bowing to none, prepare your mount for war. You who would not serve, protected those who served you behind high walls - and rode down those who would not. Fight now, sarauniya, and gain what is yours.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_ASHOKA">
			<Text>Chakravartin Ashoka, the wheel-turning monarch, your success in war made plain to you its costs. Determined to end the cycle of violence that marked your time as emperor of Maurya, you brought wisdom instead of swords, the dharma in place of destruction, and a message of non-violence to all beings. The world now needs your wisdom.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_AUGUSTUS">
			<Text>First among equals, Augustus Caesar claims his right. You, who never call yourself Emperor, are revered by your people as a god. The world now is disorder; you will give it form. The world is leaderless; you will provide it direction. Set the laurels on your head and issue your commands - lead your people to glory, and your name will become synonymous with rule.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN">
			<Text>Writer, printer, and inventor, you offer your counsel to all who ask - and many who do not.

Benjamin Franklin, bring your sound advice, and let us ensure that the sun rises on your people.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_CATHERINE">
			<Text>Catherine the Great, Tsarina of the Romanovs, you bring beauty to autocracy. With your keen eye, you transform not only your palace, but your people.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_CHARLEMAGNE">
			<Text>The clarion call of the knight’s trumpet seeks you out, Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor. In feast-halls and in troubadours’ songs, may your victories resound. In legend, may your victories remain. As your knights take the battlefield, let them know for whom they ride.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_CONFUCIUS">
			<Text>Master Kong, you gave guidance to rulers when they were lost. Now, wise one, the world is again in need of your guidance. Help us to temper duty with benevolence; help us to see with wisdom and propriety. Where the darkness of ignorance falls, lead us in the righteous path.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_FRIEDRICH">
			<Text>Though a lover of the opera house more than the battlefield, it is in the cannon’s fire that you shine. The line of attack replaces the violin’s bow, the roll of cannon stands in for the timpani, and the brass horn now calls forth iron shot. Bend your mind towards the artistry of war, Friedrich - your orchestra awaits your signal.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_HIMIKO">
			<Text>Himiko, shaman-queen of Yamatai, stands between worlds. As you bring the power of the land, you turn forests to shrines, waterfalls to music, and the mountains themselves to allies. The divine wind seeks to blow; great queen, direct its path.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_IBN_BATTUTA">
			<Text>The wanderer’s road is a long one, but there is no greater traveler than Muhammad ibn Battuta. The qadi gathers stories, resolves disputes, and compiles judgements for those who seek his wisdom. Take your pilgrim’s staff in hand, and take the first step.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_ISABELLA">
			<Text>Isabella of Castille, you united your kingdoms under one crown, and set sail the voyages that were to reshape the world.

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_LAFAYETTE">

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_PACHACUTI">
			<Text>Sapa Inca Pachacuti, Earth-Shaker, your time has come. Bring your allies among the tirakuna, in the stones and light of the high places, in the print of the puma’s paw - your people have need of you. You call to the mountains and they tremble for you. Let them tremble again.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_MACHIAVELLI">
			<Text>A spider in his web, or a writer at his desk, you, Niccolo Machiavelli, see the world as it is, untempered by convention or sentimentality. To succeed in this world requires unconscionable acts, and it is a brave heart that can be made a stone. The time has come to set your plans in motion.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_LEADER_INTRO_TEXT_TRUNG_TRAC">
			<Text>With a cry of defiance, you stand against those who would impose their will. Though your enemies, Trung Trac, may be many, you will make them pay for each step they take in your lands.  Raise your cry, and call upon your people to stand with you. The sky darkens.</Text>
		</Row>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_LOADING_CIV_TIP_03">
