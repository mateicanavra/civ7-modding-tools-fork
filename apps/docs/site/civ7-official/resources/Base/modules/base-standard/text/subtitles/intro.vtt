00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.000
The past is more than what we leave behind.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.000
We celebrate our triumphs...

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.000
...and bury our regrets.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Every age has its secrets.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.000
In each layer of history, we can rediscover hope -

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
a way to chart our future -

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Countless stories are carved into the earth's strata.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
The lessons of one age augur the next.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
We must learn from our past.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
The future is waiting.
