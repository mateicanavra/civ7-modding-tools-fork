			<Text>In the 670s, a powerful branch of Bulgars led by Khan Asparuch arrived in the Danube region with intent to settle. At the time, the territory was tenuously held by the Byzantine Empire; the expansion of the Avar Khaganate and an alliance among local Slavic tribes had recently challenged their authority. The Bulgars, a Turkic people from the Volga-Caspian region, had followed the Avars out of the Eurasian steppe after the collapse of the short-lived unified territories of Old Great Bulgaria. But unlike the peripatetic Avars, who maintained their nomadic empire, Asparuch’s Bulgars were beginning to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle and sought a permanent territory to make their own. </Text>

			<Text>Forging an alliance with the unified Slavic tribes, Asparuch crossed the Danube River in 680. His progress was immediately challenged by Emperor Constantine IV, but the Bulgars decisively routed the Byzantine army at the Battle of Ongal. Their victory resulted in a favorable peace treaty that, to the chagrin of Byzantium, recognized Bulgaria as a state and ceded to it all land north of the Balkan Mountains. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>The early period of the First Bulgarian Empire was characterized by state-building and the transition from nomadic to sedentary life. A capital was built at Pliska, out of stone to ensure its longevity, and an agricultural economy began to flourish. But it was also an era of expansion. The empire’s organization still followed the familiar military hierarchies of the Bulgars’ nomadic origins, and much of its wealth was sourced from warfare, primarily raiding in the rich Byzantine lands to the south. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4">
			<Text>The relationship between the Bulgars and the Byzantines was always complex, and helped define Bulgarian identity throughout the Middle Ages. The Bulgars were aggressive towards Byzantium because raiding funded their young state, and because a Byzantine takeover was always a (realistic) risk. Yet they also craved the validation of power that came with recognition from the Eastern Roman Empire, whether through treaties or titles gifted to Bulgar leaders (Asparuch’s successor Terval, for instance, helped the deposed Justinian II regain his throne and was awarded the title “caesar,” much to his great pleasure). Over the centuries, Byzantium’s proximity increasingly influenced many facets of Bulgaria, from politics and religion to literature and the arts. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5">
			<Text>The Byzantines, for their part, resented the threat at their northern doorstep. Occasionally they found use for the Bulgars, mainly weaponizing them against opponents during civil wars, but they were largely seen as a thorn in the empire’s side. The Byzantines had bigger fish to fry – their primary rival during this era was the Abbasid Caliphate, which posed a far greater danger. To avoid fighting on two fronts, they attempted to pacify the Bulgars with treaties and coin while at war in the East, saving their Balkan campaigns for lulls in that larger conflict unless otherwise provoked. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6">
			<Text>The Bulgars were ferocious fighters and made excellent use of the Balkans’ complex terrain. They knew the land and developed tricks and ambush tactics to gain the upper hand against opponents who often far outnumbered them. These strengths made them deadly raiders, and also paid off in larger battles, as at Pliska in 811, when Khan Krum destroyed a Byzantine army led by Nikephoros I. The emperor himself was killed in the battle, and Krum celebrated by turning his skull into a drinking cup.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7">
			<Text>The victory at Pliska triggered a period of peace that opened new opportunities for Bulgaria to evolve as a state. Cyril and Methodius, two Byzantine missionaries, began traveling the Balkans to convert its Bulgar and Slavic inhabitants. In order to better communicate their teachings, they invented an alphabet, Glagolitic, for the Slavic language so that it could be written down. Along with the conversion to Orthodox Christianity, the cultural lines between Bulgar nobility and Slavic population were also blurring, with the Bulgars increasingly assimilating to the local culture. These shifts in Bulgarian identity strengthened the kingdom into a more unified entity while also opening new lines of (peaceful) political and economic communication with wider Christian Europe. </Text>

			<Text>The zenith of the First Bulgarian Empire came during the reign of Simeon I (893-927). Educated in Constantinople, he grew his kingdom both culturally and geographically. He was a patron of art and literature, and developed the new capital Preslav into an impressive metropolis. He also launched military campaigns that expanded Bulgarian territory as far south as the Aegean and Adriatic coasts. But it was not to last. In 1014, Basil II annihilated the Bulgarian army at Kleidion, for which he gained the epithet “Bulgar Slayer.” In the aftermath, the Bulgarian Empire gave up its independence and succumbed to Byzantine authority for the next 150 years.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9">
			<Text>During this intermission, the Bulgars did not go quietly into the night. There were attempts to regain independence, most notably in 1040, when Peter Delyan managed to capture a large portion of the western Balkans before being defeated by Michael IV. (The young Norwegian prince Harald Hardrada took part in Michael’s campaign as a member of the Varangian Guard, earning a promotion for his contribution.) Less violently, but still aggressively, Byzantium also attempted to Hellenize the Balkans starting with an overhaul of the Bulgarian church. However, turmoil in other provinces caused by the Crusades and incursions by the Seljuk Turks prevented meaningful progress on this front. </Text>

			<Text>In 1185, brothers Peter and Ivan Asen organized a rebellion for independence. After two years of hard fighting, Byzantium finally recognized Bulgaria as an independent kingdom once more – the Second Bulgarian Empire. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_11">
			<Text>This chapter saw progress continue to be built upon the foundations of the First Empire, as well as adaptation to the region’s increasingly complex politics. While Bulgaria had formerly sought recognition from its formidable southern neighbor, Byzantium was weakening, and its approval (and its gifts) no longer held the same value or luster. Peter Asen’s successor, his brother Kaloyan, instead sought validation from the other Rome – the one in the West. Shortly after Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade, he and the Bulgarian Church were recognized by Pope Innocent III as Emperor and Patriarchy. Bulgaria subsequently found a new enemy in the short-lived Latin Empire.  </Text>

			<Text>The pinnacle of the Second Empire came under Ivan Asen II (1218-1241). Despite continued conflicts with neighbors, warfare was no longer the foundation of the Bulgarian economy. The expansion of the empire’s borders incorporated additional fertile land, and much of society was driven by agriculture. But Bulgaria also took advantage of its prime location as a crossroads between East and West, and revitalized itself as a strong center of trade. With this heightened economy, the arts flourished. A new capital was established at Tarnovo, and an extensive movement of creative output emerged under the Tarnovo Schools. Artists, architects, and writers generated a wealth of beauty and knowledge, both religious and secular. Urban centers grew rapidly, while remote mountains hosted both fortresses and monasteries.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BULGARIA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_13">
			<Text>After the death of Ivan Asen II, things turned sour for Bulgaria. Internally, the rift between aristocracy and peasantry grew extreme and led to several revolts, at one point enabling a swineherd to temporarily take the throne. Externally, the shifting world put pressure on the weakening empire from all sides – the Mongols from the north, the Serbs from the east, and eventually the Ottomans from the south. It was this final threat that proved deadly. Throughout the late 14th century, the Ottomans steadily advanced through the Balkans until they took Tarnovo in 1393. By 1396, with its last ruler dead and all territory lost, the Second Bulgarian Empire ceased to be.  </Text>

			<Text>In the 10th century CE, the monk Ivan (or John) of Rila retreated to the Rila Mountains to live as a hermit. He became known for miracles, attracting many followers who flocked to his isolated cave to learn from him and receive his blessing. These visitors set up shelters for themselves, at first temporary, then permanent – the original Rila Monastery. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_WONDER_RILA_MONASTERY_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Over the centuries, the monastery has undergone many changes. It has been destroyed and rebuilt several times, and the complex today represents many eras of Bulgarian art, architecture, and history, though all heavily inspired by the Tarnovo Artistic School of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Throughout its long life, Rila Monastery has remained a symbol of Bulgarian spirituality, artistic achievement, and identity. It remains an active monastery today. </Text>

			<Text>Nestled in the Balkan mountains, near the town of Belogradchik, rises a rocky outcrop with a secret – an ancient garrison once nestled at the heart of its peaks, concealed behind natural ramparts. These small fortresses dotted the rough landscape of the Bulgarian Empires. They were constructed in strategic locations that were largely protected by the terrain: steep cliffs, narrow valleys, convenient outcrops. The location was further reinforced and buildings erected to house soldiers and provisions. Smaller fortresses were often designed to be hidden from passing eyes, to allow for covert surveillance or surprise attack – one of many ways in which the Bulgars leveraged the land against their foes. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_HIDDEN_FORTRESS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Not many of these hidden fortresses remain today, but the most remarkable is the one at Belogradchik. It was first fortified during the Roman era and was reinforced and expanded several times, by the Byzantines, the Bulgars, and finally the Ottomans; it was a particularly important site for an offshoot Bulgarian state centered in Vidin. Today it has a far more noticeable footprint that extends beyond its crags, but the original citadel still manages to blend in with the landscape.  </Text>

			<Text>When the Bulgars arrived in Eastern Europe from their Central Asian homeland, they found a land already populated by Slavic peoples. According to Byzantine chronicler Theophanes, the Danube region was home to seven tribes who united during the seventh century to fend off the Byzantines to the south and the Avars to the west. But they did not make a stand against the Bulgars – instead they allied themselves with the new arrivals, accepting the authority of the Bulgar khan Asparuch. This united force soon routed the Byzantines and crossed the Danube to establish the First Bulgarian Empire.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_EX_BULGARIA_SEVEN_TRIBES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Slavs continued to be a crucial population within the realm, and over time, the Turkic Bulgars assimilated with local customs, culture, and language. By the tenth century they had become effectively Slavic themselves.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_EX_BULGARIA_TARNOVO_SCHOOLS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>During the Second Bulgarian Empire, the capital city of Tarnovo was a center for artistic, architectural, and literary achievement. Creative minds congregated within their respective schools in a remarkable burst of production. The Architectural School used intricate brickwork and played with Byzantine-influenced designs to raise ornamented buildings both religious and secular, forging a new distinctly Bulgarian style. Their structures were further enhanced by the Artistic School, who covered walls and ceilings with murals and mosaics; painters also applied their skills to smaller works, like manuscript illuminations and icons. The spread of literacy saw the growth of the Literary School and its outpouring of texts ranging from saints’ lives and psalters to histories and folktales. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_EX_BULGARIA_TARNOVO_SCHOOLS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The growth of the Tarnovo Schools solidified Tarnovo as a thriving cultural capital, and the works of these artists and writers offered new avenues of engagement with spirituality, education, and self-representation. The schools also fostered private appreciation of art through manuscripts and icons – at least for those who could afford them. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_EX_BULGARIA_TSARSTVIE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The transition of the nomadic Bulgars into an established empire (“tsarstvie”) was a remarkable feat both aided and complicated by its location between East and West. The steady assimilation of the Bulgars with local Slavic peoples hastened the growth of the early kingdom, leveraging both identities into a new polity set to endure for centuries. But Bulgaria was also situated at a juncture between major powers that heavily shaped its development. By far its most intense relationship was with Byzantium, whose influence was pervasive throughout both Bulgarian empires. The West increasingly became a source of power, wealth, and inspiration as the Bulgars sought new opportunities beyond Constantinople’s orbit. Throughout its long and tumultuous history, Bulgaria’s knack for adaptation and growth ensured its longevity, even as its core identity remained staunchly Bulgarian. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_UNIT_BOYAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Known as a boila during the First Bulgarian Empire, a bolyar was an aristocrat of the Second Empire. These nobles held both civic and military roles, holding regional power during peacetime and responsible for activating during war. As highly ranked soldiers, they provided skills that made the Bulgarian army so effective – strong horsemanship and deep knowledge of the land. The cavalry was so valuable that neglect of a horse, even in peacetime, was harshly penalized. </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_UNIT_BOYAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The bolyar title was hereditary, and within their ranks there was an additional hierarchy, with a handful of greater bolyars serving as a royal council and the lesser bolyars focusing on regional governance. </Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_UNIT_BALIK_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>“Tarkhan” is a Turkic word for a high-ranking military officer and/or provincial governor. The term was widely used among ancient and medieval peoples of Central Asia, and the Bulgars applied it to their own hierarchy before migrating west. The establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire saw the Bulgar population transition quickly from nomadic to sedentary, but the political and military organization of their steppe origins persisted during this era in the application of titles, duties, and divisions of power. This continuity included the role of the tarkhans, whose internal ranks were distinguished by additional titles (zhupan-tarkhan, oglu-tarkhan, kalu-tarkhan, etc.). </Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_UNIT_BALIK_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Bulgars’ Turkic origins faded over time as their state evolved due to assimilation with the local Slavic population, heavy influence from the Byzantine Empire, and eventual conversion to Christianity. Yet while the duties of the tarkhan faded, the title survived, and can be found in sources as late as the 12th century. </Text>
