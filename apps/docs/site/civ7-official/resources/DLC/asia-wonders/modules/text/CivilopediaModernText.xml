			<Text>The principle of ubudiah in the Qurâ€™an instructs Muslims to surrender to the divine alone, and it is this principle that guided the construction of the Ubudiah Mosque. Islam came to Southeast Asia in the 12th century, and formed the basis for a new, globally-connected chain of sultanates across the Malay world. Of these, the sultanate of Perak, now in Malaysia, gained prominence and wealth, even under British domination in the 19th and early 20th centuries. </Text>

			<Text>Here, Sultan Idris Shah I built a mosque in gratitude for having recovered from illness. Completed in 1917, the mosque is made of Italian marble topped by golden domes in a South Asian style (though designed by a British architect). War, and a fight between two elephants, delayed the construction, but it remains a symbol of Kuala Kangsar and Perak today, and serves the Muslim community of Perak as an active mosque.</Text>
