			<Text>One of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb built c. 353-351 BCE for Mausolus, ruler of Caria in western Anatolia. It was a magnificent structure designed and decorated by the most talented Greek architects and sculptors of the day, boasting elaborate reliefs, hundreds of sculptures, and a four-horse chariot at its peak, in which stood statues of Mausolus and his wife (and sister) Artemisia. It is from Mausolus and his tomb that the word “mausoleum” originates. The structure survived well into the Middle Ages, but was destroyed, likely by an earthquake, between the 11th and 15th centuries CE, though fragments remain.</Text>
