			<Text>A large, active volcano in the center of Japan’s main island of Honshu, Mount Fuji rises in a smooth cone, and has a snowcap for most of the year. Owing to its beauty, it has been a symbol of the islands for millennia, having graced the woodcuts of Hokusai, the poetry of Basho, and remains an important site of Shinto worship and pilgrimage. Atop its peak is a shrine, and the slopes are a place of both religious and recreational trekking.</Text>

			<Text>A near-vertical plane of rock extending upward from the Annapurna range of the Nepali Himalayas, Machapuchare has never been climbed. While it is not the height of Everest, standing only over 22,000 feet, it rises out of relatively low land, giving it a striking profile. This, perhaps, is the reason why it held sacred by peoples living around it, both by highland Tibetan groups and by Nepali people, who claim it to be the dwelling place of the god Shiva. For these reasons, the Nepali government is extremely reluctant to grant climbing permits for the slopes. </Text>

			<Text>In the southwest corner of Bulgaria, the Pirin mountains rise sharply from the valleys below. At their heart sits Vihren, the tallest mountain in the range and the third tallest in the Balkans. At 2,914 meters, the pyramidal peak is a stark exemplar of karst topography; at its base sits the southernmost glacier in Europe, the Snezhnika glacieret. Following a longstanding association of the Pirin mountains with Perun, the Slavic god of storms, Vihren’s name means “whirlwind.” It remains a popular destination for climbers today. </Text>

			<Text>Deep in the Peruvian Andes lies Vinicunca, the mountain of seven colors. Its bright tones are the result of a mixture of minerals: pink from red clay, white from quartz and marl, purple from limonite and goethite, red from iron, green from chlorite, brown from magnesium, and yellow from calcareous sandstone. Vinicunca was only recently discovered in 2013. It was historically concealed beneath a glacier, but Earth’s rising temperatures have now melted its permanent snow. It has since become one of Peru’s major tourist attractions.</Text>
