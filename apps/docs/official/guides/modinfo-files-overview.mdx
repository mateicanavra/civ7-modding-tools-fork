A `.modinfo` file is the linchpin of any mod. At its core, a `.modinfo` file is just an XML file structured in a particular way and given the `.modinfo` file extension.

It tells the game what files to load and what to do with them. It tells the game how a mod relates to other mods and to DLC. It stores all the basic info about the mod (such as the name, author, and so on)!

For those coming from modding Civ VI, the structure of a `.modinfo` file should be very familiar to you, although there are a number of differences.

If you're ever in need of references, check out the various `.modinfo` files in the example mods, or in the game files (yes! The game's modules and DLCs are structured in the same way as mods!).

# Sample .modinfo file

This is a sample `.modinfo` file. You can copy the code here to use as base for your own `.modinfo` files:

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="official-guides-modinfo-files-overview__1b7984ae" tag="xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Mod id="fxs-new-policies" version="1"
    xmlns="ModInfo">
    <Properties>
        <Name>Antiquity Policies</Name>
        <Description>Adds new policies to the Antiquity Age</Description>
        <Authors>Firaxis</Authors>
        <AffectsSavedGames>1</AffectsSavedGames>
    </Properties>
