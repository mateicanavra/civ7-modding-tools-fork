## Discoveries

Discoveries are a subset of Narrative Events, replacing the various "goody huts" from previous games in the series. Discoveries are triggered by moving onto one of a variety of landmarks that appear on the map.

Making a Discovery is mostly the same as making a Narrative Event with a few quirks.

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="official-guides-narrative-events-discoveries__916e2d9c" tag="xml"
    <Types>

        StoryTitle="LOC_DISCOVERY_FXS_MY_EVENT_STORYTITLE"

        Queue="NARRATIVE_GROUP_DISCOVERY_CAMPFIRE_BASIC"

        StartEveryone="TRUE"
        FirstOnly="TRUE"
        ForceChoice="TRUE"

        Activation="AUTO"
        UIActivation="DISCOVERY"
        RequirementSetId="REQSET_DISCOVERY_BASE_NARRATIVE"
    />
 </NarrativeStories>
<NarrativeStoryOverrides>
    <Row NarrativeStoryType="DISCOVERY_FXS_MY_EVENT" OverriddenStoryType="DISCOVERY_BASE"/>
 </NarrativeStoryOverrides>
```

For the initial Discovery:

1. Set `StartEveryone`, `FirstOnly`, and `ForceChoice` to true.
2. Set `Activation` to `AUTO`.
3. Set `UIActivation` to `DISCOVERY`.
4. Set `RequirementSetId` to `REQSET_DISCOVERY_BASE_NARRATIVE`.
5. Add the new event to the `NarrativeStoryOverrides` table, overriding the `DISCOVERY_BASE`  Story Type.
6. Choose a `Queue` for the Discovery.

The `Queue` determines two things:

1. In what type of Landmark can your custom event be found. (e.g. Campfire, Cave, Shipwreck)
2. How likely the Discovery is to spawn. (e.g. Basic, Investigation, or Mythic)

You can see a full list of queues in the `NarrativeStory_Queues` table.

![](/civ7-official/modding/guides/images/InitialDiscovery.png)

You will also want to assign the `DISCOVERY_BASE_REWARD` to this initial Narrative Event.

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="official-guides-narrative-events-discoveries__4f81af03" tag="xml"
<NarrativeStory_Rewards>
    <Row
        NarrativeStoryType="DISCOVERY_FXS_MY_EVENT"
        NarrativeRewardType="DISCOVERY_BASE_REWARD"
        Activation="COMPLETE"
        BonusEligible="FALSE"
    />
 </NarrativeStory_Rewards>
```

The `DISCOVERY_BASE_REWARD` NarrativeRewardType is just a predefined Reward Type that is used to remove the landmark from the tile when the discovery is triggered.

The process to add choices to your new Discovery is the same as with standard Narrative Events: just create further Narrative Events exactly how you would normally (the only difference is you will likely want to use `DISCOVERY` for the `UIActivation`). You can define icons, text replacements, quests/imperatives, for those linked Narratives events if you want as well.

# Appendix

## `REQUIREMENT_PLAYER_HAS_AT_LEAST_NUM_GOSSIPS`

### Introduction

`REQUIREMENT_PLAYER_HAS_AT_LEAST_NUM_GOSSIPS` is a very flexible `RequirementType` frequently used with Narrative Events. It overlaps with various other `RequirementTypes`, but can be easier to set up than a more complicated `RequirementSet`.

It works with the Gossip system, which keeps tracks of various goings-on in the game. This can be everything from founding cities, and meeting players, to killing units.

To use `REQUIREMENT_PLAYER_HAS_AT_LEAST_NUM_GOSSIPS`, you provide a list of Gossip types. For each provided Gossip type, you may also provide additional parameters to check for. Then for each provided  Gossip type, it checks that there is at least one gossip that matches it and the provided parameters.

If the number of Gossip Types with at least one match is equal to at least the provided `Amount`, the requirement is met.

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="official-guides-narrative-events-discoveries__bc39ddcf" tag="xml"
<Requirement type="REQUIREMENT_PLAYER_HAS_AT_LEAST_NUM_GOSSIPS">
    <Argument name="GossipTypes">GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01,GOSSIP_TRADITION_ACTIVATED02</Argument>
    <Argument name="GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01">Hash,ConstructibleType,BUILDING_BLACKSMITH</Argument>
    <Argument name="GOSSIP_TRADITION_ACTIVATED02">Hash,TraditionType,TRADITION_CRAFTSMANSHIP</Argument>
    <Argument name="Amount">2</Argument>
 </Requirement>
```

This example checks that a Blacksmith has been built (`GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01`) and the Craftsmanship Policy has been slotted (`GOSSIP_TRADITION_ACTIVATED02`. Remember that it checks for the number of Gossip Types that have at least one match (as opposed to the total number of Gossips that matches one of the provided Gossip Types + Parameters) so you cannot simply build two Blacksmiths to meet this requirement.

Note how each Gossip Type is followed by a two digit number: this determines the order in which the Gossips are processed. Additionally, note that for each Gossip Type there is a matching additional argument.

These additional arguments are the parameters to check for that Gossip Type. A parameter comes as a set of three keywords in this order: "Parameter Type", "Parameter Name", "Value to Check for". From the above example `Hash,ConstructibleType,BUILDING_BLACKSMITH` checks for a parameter named `ConstructibleType`, which is set to `BUILDING_BLACKSMITH`, which is a `Hash` value.

> **Note:** 
> The surest way to figure how what `GossipTypes` you can use, and what parameters you can use for each type, is to check the game files for examples how this requirement has already been used.
> 
> Alternatively see below for a list of `GossipTypes` and parameters you can use with each type.

There can be multiple parameters per argument, as seen below. Remember that a single parameter comes as a set of three.

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="official-guides-narrative-events-discoveries__ec3fde87" tag="xml"
<Requirement type="REQUIREMENT_PLAYER_HAS_AT_LEAST_NUM_GOSSIPS">
    <Argument name="GossipTypes">GOSSIP_CONQUER_CITY01,GOSSIP_CONQUER_CITY02</Argument>
    <Argument name="GOSSIP_CONQUER_CITY01">Hash,OriginalCivilization,CIVILIZATION_GREECE,Hash,OtherPlayer,Other</Argument>
    <Argument name="GOSSIP_CONQUER_CITY01">Hash,IsCapital,True,Hash,OriginalCivilization,CIVILIZATION_ROME,Hash,OtherPlayer,Other</Argument>
    <Argument name="Amount">2</Argument>
 </Requirement>
```

This example checks that the player has conquered a Greek city and the Roman Capital. Like the previous requirement, you cannot simply conquer two cities from Greece to meet this requirement.

These additional requirements can also be omitted entirely, in which case, any gossip of the correct type will count towards the Gossip Type being met.

### Arguments
#### `Amount`

Minimum amount of Gossip Types with a match found for this Requirement to be met. If omitted, defaults to one.
#### `GossipTypes`

Comma separated list of one or more Gossip Types. Each listed Gossip Type should be followed by a two digit number starting at 01 (for example `GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01`). Each listed Gossip Type can be added as an additional Modifier Argument with a list of parameters to check for.
#### `DuplicateCount`

Sometimes you will want to check for multiple instances of a single Gossip type, with identical parameters. For instance, you may want to check that a player has built 3 Monuments. 
  
The sample below tells the modifier to check for multiple instances of the `GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING` Modifier, with its `ConstructibleType` set to `BUILDING_MONUMENT`. So you will have to have built three separate monuments for this requirement to be met.

This argument can **ONLY** be used when a **single Gossip Type** is provided. It cannot be used with multiple Gossip Types.

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="official-guides-narrative-events-discoveries__2748663f" tag="xml"
    <Requirement type="REQUIREMENT_PLAYER_HAS_AT_LEAST_NUM_GOSSIPS">
        <Argument name="GossipTypes">GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01</Argument>
        <Argument name="GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01">Hash,ConstructibleType,BUILDING_MONUMENT</Argument>
        <Argument name="DuplicateCount">3</Argument>
    </Requirement>
```

#### `Distance`

Most (but not all), Gossips have an associated plot location for where the Gossip occurs. When **exactly two Gossip Types** are provided, this tells the game, to ensure that the met gossip instances occur within a specified distance of each other. If there are more than two gossips in the requirement and this argument is set, the requirement will never be met.
  
In the example below, the game is instructed to check that a Library and an Academy are built on the same tile (distance 0).

``` xml lines icon="file-xml" id="official-guides-narrative-events-discoveries__167b7ccc" tag="xml"
<Requirement type="REQUIREMENT_PLAYER_HAS_AT_LEAST_NUM_GOSSIPS">
    <Argument name="GossipTypes">GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01,GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING02</Argument>
    <Argument name="GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING01">Hash,ConstructibleType,BUILDING_LIBRARY</Argument>
    <Argument name="GOSSIP_CONSTRUCT_BUILDING02">Hash,ConstructibleType,BUILDING_ACADEMY</Argument>
    <Argument name="Distance">0</Argument>
    <Argument name="Amount">2</Argument>
 </Requirement>
```

#### `AfterInit`

Tells the game to only check Gossips that occur after the associated event has been initialised. This should be a boolean value (True/False).
#### `AfterTurn`

Similar to `AfterInit`, but works with a provided turn number instead. If provided, Gossips that occur before the provided turn number are ignored. This should be an integer.
#### `TurnWindow`

Checks that earliest and latest gossips occur within a specific number of turns of each other. It takes the earliest turn of the met gossips and the latest turn of the met gossips, and finds the difference. The difference must be equal to or equivalent to the `TurnWindow` for the requirement to be met. 
#### `OrderedTurnWindow`

This argument only works when **exactly two Gossip Types** are provided. It check for gossips in the ordered provided. It gets the turn the second gossip occurred, and subtracts the turn the first gossip occurred. The resulting difference must be less than or equal to `OrderedTurnWindow`, but must also be greater than or equal to 0.
  
In other words, the first gossip must occur before the second gossip, and both must occur within the provided `OrderedTurnWindow` of each other.

### List of Gossip Types
