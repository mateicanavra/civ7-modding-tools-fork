## The ModifierType

The Subject, as well as what exactly a modifier does, are determined by the `ModifierType`.

A `ModifierType` is a combination of an `EffectType` and a `CollectionType`. The Effect type determines what it does, and the collection determines who it affects.

We know enough at this point to start making a new modifier in earnest, so let's create a modifier called "Irrigation Ditches" as an example, to use with policy card of the same name.

The code below creates a new ModifierType that combines the `EFFECT_CITY_ADJUST_YIELD` effect and `COLLECTION_PLAYER_CITIES`. So when applied, it will try to **adjust City yields** in **all of a specific Player's Cities**.

``` sql lines icon="database" id="official-guides-the-modifier-system-modifiers__d1cfa420" tag="sql"
INSERT INTO Types
        (Type,                                      Kind)
VALUES  ('FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MOD_TYPE',         'KIND_MODIFIER');

INSERT INTO DynamicModifiers
    (
        ModifierType,
        CollectionType,
        EffectType
    )
VALUES
    (
        'FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MOD_TYPE',
        'COLLECTION_PLAYER_CITIES',
        'EFFECT_CITY_ADJUST_YIELD'
    );
```

We create a new modifier with the `FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MOD_TYPE` `ModifierType`. We can then assign it to the `TraditionModifiers` (which are the modifiers for Traditions and Policies), so when a player slots the Tradition into their government, the yields of all their cities are modified.

``` sql lines icon="database" id="official-guides-the-modifier-system-modifiers__1ea99e3b" tag="sql"
INSERT INTO Modifiers
    (
        ModifierId,
        ModifierType
    )
VALUES
    (
        'FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MODIFIER',
        'FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MOD_TYPE'
    );

INSERT INTO TraditionModifiers
        (
            TraditionType,
            ModifierId
        )
VALUES    (
            'TRADITION_FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES',
            'FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MODIFIER'
        );
```

## ModifierArguments

Neat, but what type of yields are we adjusting here? While a `ModifierType` determines what sort of effect a modifier has, entries in the `ModifierArguments` table control the specifics of the effect. So for example, let's tell the modifier we just made that we want to adjust the yields specifically by 5 Food!

``` sql lines icon="database" id="official-guides-the-modifier-system-modifiers__e7830193" tag="sql"
INSERT INTO ModifierArguments
    (
        ModifierId,
        Name,
        Value
    )
VALUES
    (
        'FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MODIFIER',
        'YieldType',
        'YIELD_FOOD'
    ),
    (
        'FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES_MODIFIER',
        'Amount',
        5
    );
```

`ModifierArguments` consist of a `Name`, a `Value`, and the `ModifierId` of the modifier it controls. Which argument Names are available will vary based on the `EffectType`, and the easiest way to figure that out is to look for other modifiers that share the same `EffectType` in the game files or through `gameplay-copy.sqlite` in the Debug folder.

Putting this all together we have a modifier attached to a `TRADITION_FXS_IRRIGATION_DITCHES` tradition—which technically still needs to be made—that grants +5 Food per turn to all of a specific player's cities.
