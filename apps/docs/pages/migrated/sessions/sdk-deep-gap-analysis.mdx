# Civ7 Modding Documentation Gap Analysis — Deep Dive

## Scope

Cross-reference community modding guides with the official SDK resources to validate XML tags, module layout, and dependency files. Sampled the Shawnee Tecumseh DLC for concrete examples.

## Findings

### Modinfo Validation
- `docs/modding/community/reference/modding-reference.md` now mirrors the `<ActionGroups>` pattern used by official modules.
- `shawnee-tecumseh.modinfo` confirms the structure: each `<ActionGroup>` wraps `<Actions>` with `<UpdateDatabase>`, `<UpdateIcons>`, and `<UpdateText>` entries that list files via `<Item>` elements.

### Leader Definition
- `data/leaders.xml` in the Shawnee module defines `LEADER_TECUMSEH` with supporting `Types`, `Leaders`, `LeaderTraits`, and `TraitModifiers` tables, matching the layout used in community leader guides.

### Module Layout
- Official modules segregate content under `data/`, `text/`, `icons/`, `config/`, and `l10n/` directories. Community guides have been updated to note this layout.

### Dependency Files
- Each module ships a `.dep` file (e.g., `shawnee-tecumseh.dep`) that lists required art packages and libraries. Community docs now mention including a `.dep` when custom art or libraries are referenced.

## Remaining Questions
- Base game leader definitions appear in `leaders-gameeffects.xml` without a companion `leaders.xml`; further investigation is needed to map how leader core data is split across files.
- Additional examples from other DLC or ages could help document more patterns, such as action criteria for age-specific content.
