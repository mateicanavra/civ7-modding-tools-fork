# @civ7/plugin-mapgen

Utilities for building Civilization VII map-generation mods.

## API

- `buildMapMod(srcDir, outDir)` â€“ copy `.js`, `.xml`, and `.modinfo` files from a source directory to a target mod folder.

This package previously bundled the Epic Diverse Huge map. That content now lives in `mods/mod-swooper-maps`.
