            >Generates large, organic worlds with three continental bands and true oceans, ruggedized coasts and small island chains, and climate-aware rainfall refined by prevailing winds, orographic rain shadows, river corridors, and basin wetness. Biomes are gently nudged for playability (tropical coasts near the equator, greener temperate river valleys, restrained tundra). Compatible with base wonders, resources, and features; tuned for Huge maps.</Text>
