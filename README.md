# Civ7 Modding Tools and Resources

A comprehensive monorepo workspace for Civilization VII modding, providing tools, documentation, and an SDK for creating mods programmatically.

This repository began from [izica/civ7-modding-tools](https://github.com/izica/civ7-modding-tools) and has since diverged; it is maintained independently and extended with:
- üì¶ **[@civ7/sdk](packages/sdk)** - TypeScript SDK for programmatic mod generation
- üõ†Ô∏è **[@civ7/cli](packages/cli)** - Command-line tools for managing game resources
- üìö **[Documentation](apps/docs)** - Comprehensive modding guides and references
- üéÆ **[Playground](apps/playground)** - Examples and experimentation space

## Installation and Setup

Setting up this project is a two-step process. First, you install the project dependencies and the CLI. Second, you use the newly installed CLI to pull in the game data.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies and Link the CLI

This command will install all necessary dependencies, build the CLI, and create a global link to the `civ7` executable, making it available everywhere in your terminal.

```bash
pnpm refresh
```
You only need to run this command once for the initial setup, or whenever you pull changes that affect dependencies or the CLI source code.

**Note:** After running this command, you may need to open a new terminal session or source your shell's profile file (e.g., `source ~/.zshrc`) for the `civ7` command to become available.

### Step 2: Refresh Game Data

After the `civ7` command is available, you can use it to populate the repository with the official game data from your local Civilization VII installation. This script runs `civ7 zip` and `civ7 unzip` in sequence using the `default` profile.

```bash
pnpm refresh:data
```

You can run this command whenever you want to ensure the local resource data is up-to-date with your game files.

## Using the CLI

Once set up, you can use the `civ7` command directly to manage game resource archives. Its behavior is configured by the `civ.config.jsonc` file located in the project root. You can customize the default profiles or add your own.

### Unzipping Resources
```bash
# Unzip using the 'default' profile
civ7 unzip

# Unzip using the 'full' profile
civ7 unzip full

# Override the source archive and destination directory
civ7 unzip default ./my-archive.zip ./my-output-dir
```

### Zipping Resources
```bash
# Zip using the 'default' profile
civ7 zip

# Zip using the 'assets' profile with verbose output
civ7 zip --verbose assets

# Use a custom config file instead of the one in the project root
civ7 zip --config ./my-custom-config.jsonc default
```

### Profiles
- **default**: Includes core gameplay data and excludes large assets. Ideal for quick, focused modding tasks.
- **full**: Includes almost all game resources, suitable for comprehensive analysis.
- **assets**: Includes only media like icons, fonts, and movies.


## Getting Started with Mod Generation

The SDK provides strongly-typed builders for creating mods. For detailed documentation, see the [SDK README](packages/sdk/README.md).

### Quick Example

```typescript
import { Mod, UnitBuilder } from '@civ7/sdk';

const mod = new Mod({ id: 'my-mod', version: '1.0.0' });
// Add builders and generate
mod.build('./output');
```

For complete examples, check the [playground](apps/playground/src/examples/).
