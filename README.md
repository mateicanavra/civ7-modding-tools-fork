# Civ7 Modding Tools and Resources

A comprehensive monorepo workspace for Civilization VII modding, providing tools, documentation, and an SDK for creating mods programmatically.

This repository began from [izica/civ7-modding-tools](https://github.com/izica/civ7-modding-tools) and has since diverged; it is maintained independently and extended with:
- 📦 **[@civ7/sdk](packages/sdk)** - TypeScript SDK for programmatic mod generation
- 🛠️ **[@civ7/cli](packages/cli)** - Command-line tools for managing game resources
- 📚 **[Documentation](apps/docs)** - Comprehensive modding guides and references
- 🎮 **[Playground](apps/playground)** - Examples and experimentation space
- 🔌 **[Plugin libraries](packages/plugins)** - Reusable file and graph logic consumed by the CLI

## Installation and Setup

Setting up this project is a two-step process. First, you install the project dependencies and the CLI. Second, you use the newly installed CLI to pull in the game data.

### Prerequisites
- Node 20 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Optional: pin pnpm via Corepack for reproducibility
  ```bash
  pnpm run setup:corepack
  ```

### Step 1: Install Dependencies and Link the CLI

This command will install all necessary dependencies, build the CLI, and create a global link to the `civ7` executable, making it available everywhere in your terminal.

```bash
pnpm refresh
```
You only need to run this command once for the initial setup, or whenever you pull changes that affect dependencies or the CLI source code.

**Note:** After running this command, you may need to open a new terminal session or source your shell's profile file (e.g., `source ~/.zshrc`) for the `civ7` command to become available.

### Step 2: Refresh Game Data

After the `civ7` command is available, you can use it to populate the repository with the official game data from your local Civilization VII installation. This script runs `civ7 zip` and then `civ7 unzip`, placing the outputs in the `.civ7/outputs` directory at the project root.

```bash
pnpm refresh:data
```

This command only needs to be run once. The `docs` and `playground` apps will automatically sync the resources they need from this central location when you run their `dev` commands. The docs app uses a fast unzip via `@civ7/plugin-files`.

## Using the CLI

Once set up, you can use the `civ7` command directly to manage game resource archives. Its behavior is configured by the `civ.config.jsonc` file located in the project root.

The configuration uses a modular structure:
- **`inputs`**: Defines where to find source files, like the game's installation directory.
- **`outputs`**: Sets the default destination for generated files (zips, extracted resources, graphs). By default, everything is placed in a `.civ7/outputs` directory to keep your project clean.
- **`profiles`**: Contains named groups of settings for specific tasks. A profile can override the default output paths, which is useful for integrating with other tools, like the docs site.

You can customize the default profiles or add your own.
