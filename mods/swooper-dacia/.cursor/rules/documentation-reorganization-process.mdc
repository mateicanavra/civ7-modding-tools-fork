# Documentation Reorganization Process for AI Agents

## Key Resources
- Official Game Documentation: https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/
- Civilization VII Fan Wiki: https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Civilization_VII
- Internal Documentation:
  - `/docs/reference/gameplay-mechanics.md` - Game mechanics reference
  - `/docs/reference/file-paths-reference.md` - File paths and structure guide
  - `/docs/reference/modding-reference.md` - Modding systems reference
  - `/docs/_sidebar.md` - Navigation structure

## Core Principles
1. Make changes incrementally and semantically grouped
2. Check in with the user after each meaningful change
3. Keep existing content and game mechanics context in mind
4. Maintain traceability of changes

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Directory Structure Changes
- Propose directory changes first
- Create directories one semantic group at a time
- Verify directory creation before proceeding

### 2. Navigation Updates
- Update sidebar/navigation to reflect new structure
- Present changes to user for review
- Only proceed after approval
- Keep paths consistent with new directory structure

### 3. Content Relocation
- Move files one semantic group at a time
- Verify each move operation
- Update internal cross-references as needed
- Check in with user after each group move

### 4. Content Splitting
- Split one document at a time
- Present split logic to user before implementing
- Maintain context from source material
- Update navigation after each split
- Verify content integrity after split

### 5. Reference Maintenance
- Update all cross-references after changes
- Verify link integrity
- Update any indexes or tables of contents

## Quality Checks
- Verify each change immediately after making it
- Ensure paths in navigation match actual file structure
- Maintain consistent formatting and style
- Keep original content intact while reorganizing

## Communication Guidelines
- Explain what you're about to do before doing it
- Report what was done after each change
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding to next step
- Flag any potential issues or uncertainties

## Important Notes
- Never proceed with multiple major changes without user review
- Always maintain a clear path back to original organization
- Keep game mechanics context in mind when reorganizing content
- Reference official documentation and resources when needed
