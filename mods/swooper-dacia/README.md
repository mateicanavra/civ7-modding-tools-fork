## Installation

1. Place the mod folder in your Civilization VII Mods directory:
   - Windows: Documents\My Games\Civilization VII\Mods
   - Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Civilization VII/Mods
   - Linux: ~/.local/share/Civilization VII/Mods

2. Launch Civilization VII and enable the mod in the Additional Content menu.

## SDK dependency

In this monorepo the mod uses the workspace SDK package `@mateicanavra/civ7-sdk`.

If you are using this mod as a standalone repo (e.g., via subtree mirror) and the GitHub package is not available to you yet, use one of the following options:

1) Install the upstream SDK and alias it to the expected name (simple fallback)

```bash
pnpm add -D civ7-modding-tools
# add this to package.json to alias the upstream to our name
# "pnpm": { "overrides": { "@mateicanavra/civ7-sdk": "npm:civ7-modding-tools@^0.0.0" } }
```

or

2) Edit this mod's package.json dependencies to point directly at the upstream

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@mateicanavra/civ7-sdk": "npm:civ7-modding-tools@^0.0.0"
  }
}
```

Either approach lets the code import `@mateicanavra/civ7-sdk` while resolving to the upstream `civ7-modding-tools` package when used outside the monorepo.

## Scripts

Use these scripts to build and deploy your mod in one step:

```bash
pnpm run build          # generate XML in mod/
pnpm run deploy         # deploys mod via the monorepo CLI
pnpm run build:deploy   # build and deploy
```
